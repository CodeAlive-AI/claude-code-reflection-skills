## B.3.3 — Assurance Subtypes & Levels

### B.3.3:1 - Problem Frame

**Use this when.** A team must decide whether the available support is enough for a particular claim and receiving use, or what a published assurance level permits a recipient to conclude. Start with that claim, use, relevant conditions, and the warrant the conclusion needs.

A performance test, a proof and a terminology comparison answer different questions. Treating their presence as a maturity recipe can approve a poorly supported performance claim while demanding an irrelevant proof from a well-supported empirical result.

**Practical gain.** Choose the assurance contribution that can change the receiving judgement, and retain a sufficient qualified result without purchasing evidence merely to raise its label.

**Ordinary boundary.** A source locator, permission, status report or direct domain result that makes no assurance claim needs no B.3.3 classification. An ordinary assurance judgement can use B.3's compact result without constructing a level scheme. A domain's required proof, study or assurance profile applies when its actual claim and use require it.

### B.3.3:2 - Problem

How can a recipient distinguish relevant conceptual, logical and empirical support without mistaking a link, evidence type, score or maturity label for an argument that the relied-on claim is adequately supported?

The tension is between comparable reporting and unlike assurance questions. Repeatable criteria help a shared use; a universal ladder hides differences in claim scope, consequences, assumptions and admissible evidence. Formal precision helps inspect an inference, but cannot compensate for an inapplicable premise.

### B.3.3:3 - Solution

Use B.3 to identify the target claim and receiving assurance use. Determine which uncertainty or possible failure matters to that use, then examine the support that bears on it. State the supported or narrowed conclusion and the limitations that change reliance. A result need not carry an `AssuranceLevel`.

#### B.3.3:3.1 - Assurance subtypes answer different questions

| Subtype | Code | Question answered | Contribution and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concept-Bridge Assurance | CBA | Do the load-bearing terms and participants correspond across the descriptions being used? | Compare the relevant meanings, referents and conditions through B.5.3 when movement across vocabularies can change the argument. A discovered or repaired mismatch can change the assurance conclusion. Performing a comparison does not itself improve a relation's congruence. |
| Verification Assurance | VA | Does the claimed consequence follow under the stated specification and assumptions? | Inspect the proof, logical argument or applicable construction. The result supports that consequence under those premises; it does not establish that a running system satisfies its environmental assumptions. |
| Validation Assurance | LA | Does the empirical basis support the claimed performance in the receiving conditions? | Examine relevance, coverage, measurement quality, limitations and contrary results. A simulation supports a claim about its modelled conditions; transfer to an actual system needs the applicable model-to-world warrant. |

Select the contributions needed by the claim, rather than demanding all three types for every judgement. A mathematical consequence may need a proof and no field trial. An engineering performance claim may have sufficient empirical support without an additional formal proof. A safety-related claim needs the actual protective argument and required evidence; neither `FV ≥ threshold` nor `EV > 0` establishes that adequacy by itself.

Terms such as `FV`, `EV` or `CL` can be used only with the bearer, scale and interpretation the receiving argument consumes, as in B.3. A field called `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy` identifies a support relation to inspect, not a positive judgement by its mere presence.

#### B.3.3:3.2 - Use a level only through its justified profile

A domain may define an assurance profile or ordered levels when a recurring receiving decision benefits from that comparison. Its definition states the claim class and use, relevant conditions, meaning of each level, evidence rules, threshold basis and reconsideration conditions. Keep the measure and its scale explicit where a threshold is used. Establish the ordering from these meanings; the numerals in `L0–L2` supply no ordering of trust across unlike uses.

Publish `AssuranceLevel` only with the applicable profile and a result showing why the target meets its criteria. The legacy names `Unsubstantiated`, `Substantiated` and `Axiomatic` do not supply default criteria. In particular, an axiomatic or constructive justification concerns a particular consequence or construction, not a universally higher assurance state than empirical support. A conjecture's origin in abduction likewise does not assign it `L0`.

Examine whether a demanded threshold or evidence requirement protects the relevant quantity well enough to justify its cost, delay and displaced work. Keep that judgement distinct from the conditions presently binding the action. A recommendation to amend a requirement does not change it or confer amendment authority.

For a one-off receiving use, stop with the sufficient qualified assurance result. Do not create a profile, fill unused level fields or explain the omission of a level solely to complete this pattern.

#### B.3.3:3.3 - Preserve scope and inspect the actual grounding

Keep a design-time `MethodDescription` claim separate from a claim about performed `Work` or its `Trace`. Cite evidence with the appropriate conditions and scope. Evidence for a parent claim covers a child claim only through an argument establishing that coverage; a declaration of inheritance is insufficient.

State structural claims as readable Working-Model relations. When a publication choice or current requirement elects B.3.5's CT2R-LOG profile, follow its relation-specific grounding: structural parthood uses the applicable C.13 `sum` or `slice` construction trace; collection belonging uses the collection's `set` trace. These elected branches declare `validationMode=axiomatic`. Other permitted relation claims retain their applicable logical or empirical support. A level label alone does not elect this profile.

A grounding account and the author's `validationMode` are inputs to inspect. Neither creates the relation, makes an empirical premise true, nor decides its currentness. Assurance publications remain downstream of the Working-Model surface under E.14.

#### B.3.3:3.4 - Worked case: a useful empirical result and an irrelevant fresh test

A team is deciding whether a converter can be used for non-safety-critical measurements within a declared temperature and input range. In this example, the receiving task's justified tolerance is 2%. Calibration results covering that range, an adequate measurement-error account and applicable operating observations support error below that tolerance. The team can return “supported for this measurement use within the stated range,” with its actual limitations. A formal proof of unrelated program properties is unnecessary.

Now replace that basis with a newly passed boot test and a glossary mapping. These establish startup behaviour and the intended term correspondences, not measurement accuracy. The same requested measurement use remains unsupported. Neither fresh evidence nor one link of each required type repairs the missing performance basis.

If the recipient instead needs a mathematical invariant, inspect the proof under its assumptions. If the application introduces a protective function or a different operating range, reopen the affected assurance question under its own threshold and evidence rules. The earlier limited result remains an account of what it supported.

### B.3.3:4 - Conformance Checklist

A Target of Assurance (ToA) denotes the claim being assessed for the named use, not an undifferentiated score for its whole system.

- **CC-B3.3.1 (Relevant support):** A positive assurance conclusion MUST identify the relied-on claim and use and explain how the cited basis supports it. A `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy` link alone is insufficient.
- **CC-B3.3.2 (Needed correspondence):** Where differing terms or participants can change the argument, the assessor MUST resolve the load-bearing correspondence through the applicable bridge. Other judgements have no general term-mapping prerequisite.
- **CC-B3.3.3 (Qualified levels and thresholds):** A published level MUST have an applicable profile, interpreted criteria and a supported assignment. Formal, empirical and constructive evidence requirements MUST follow the specific claim and receiving use. A generic score threshold or positive validation score cannot substitute for the required protective argument.
- **CC-B3.3.4 (Bridge scope):** A required bridge MUST cover the differences on which the conclusion depends. It SHALL NOT demand mapping every mechanism term to FPF as the price of an otherwise sufficient ordinary judgement.
- **CC-B3.3.5 (Scope separation):** Design-time and run-time assurance claims MUST retain their distinct subjects, evidence and conditions. A design result SHALL NOT be published as evidence that the corresponding Work performed successfully.
- **CC-B3.3.6 (CT2R-LOG grounding):** When B.3.5's profile is elected, the structural and collection branches MUST retain their distinct current construction traces and declared modes. A level assignment SHALL NOT replace the required grounding or impose the profile on unrelated claims.
- **CC-B3.3.7 (Downward-only dependence):** Assurance publications or records SHALL NOT impose vocabulary or layout back onto the Working-Model surface.

### B.3.3:5 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Failure in use | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tested but referring to different things | Requirements and architecture use “Sensor” for different participants; the test concerns only one. | Resolve that correspondence and re-examine affected claims; more test links do not fix it. |
| Perfect blueprint, unsupported operation | A proof assumes conditions that the actual system has not been shown to meet. | Obtain or use the needed empirical and assumption evidence for the actual claim, or narrow the conclusion. |
| Maturity by receipt | A fresh smoke test and a term mapping receive a positive performance label. | Judge the support for the requested performance, not the receipt count or type combination. |
| Proof as an admission toll | Sufficient empirical support is rejected because an unrelated formal proof is absent. | Apply the receiving claim's evidence rules; retain formal proof obligations where their contribution is necessary. |

### B.3.3:6 - Consequences

Recipients can inspect what an assurance result supports and why a stronger use remains open. Teams direct effort towards relevant gaps and can reuse genuinely covering evidence.

Comparability becomes profile-specific. Defining a useful shared profile takes judgement about consequences, criteria and evidence; routine uses avoid that overhead. Review remains fallible and contestable rather than becoming objective merely because a status is computed.

### B.3.3:7 - Rationale

A claim, argument and evidence have different functions. Assurance improves when a contribution closes a relevant gap under applicable assumptions. Counting evidence types or increasing formality cannot guarantee that improvement.

B.3 supplies this claim-and-use structure and its source account. [ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026-2:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/80625.html) concerns the structure and maintenance of assurance cases. This pattern adapts maintained, inspectable support to a receiving use; its subtype distinction and optional level profiles are FPF choices, not a level ladder attributed to that standard. Reconsider a local profile when its evidence model, receiving decision or threshold basis changes.

### B.3.3:8 - Relations

- **B.3, A.10 and C.2.1:** define the assurance result, evidence-use references and target claim.
- **B.5.3 and B.3.5/C.13:** supply needed concept correspondence and the elected, relation-specific construction account.
- **A.4 and E.14:** preserve design/run separation and the direction from Working-Model claims to assurance publications.
- **B.3.4 and C.27.TA:** qualify currentness by the relied-on use, conditions and temporal reference.
- **C.11 and C.19.2:** support the choice of worthwhile additional evidence when that decision is live.
- **B.4 and Part D:** may consume a qualified assurance result in their actual transition or decision rules; this pattern supplies neither an automatic evolution gate nor risk-acceptance authority.
