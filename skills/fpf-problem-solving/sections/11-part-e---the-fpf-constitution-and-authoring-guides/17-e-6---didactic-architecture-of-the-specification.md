## E.6 - Didactic Architecture of the Specification

### E.6:1 - Problem frame
FPF addresses readers who differ in at least two respects:

* **Disciplinary** – systems engineers, knowledge scientists, ethicists.
* **Experience** – newcomers need intuition; experts need rigour.

Past drafts mixed governance mandates with domain examples, producing a
steep learning curve and repeated “forward‑reference” detours.

### E.6:2 - Problem
If core ideas are buried under formalism or scattered across parts,
readers either give up or misuse the framework. We need a didactic
macro-order that guides cognitive load from low to high while keeping
normative sections discoverable, without letting readers confuse
document order with one universal first-practical workflow.

### E.6:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Cognitive Load** | Early clarity ↔ eventual formal depth. |
| **Conceptual Integrity** | Foregoing examples risks abstraction ↔ too many examples delay axioms. |
| **Didactic order vs practical entry** | Stable document macro-order ↔ truthful first-practical routes that may cross parts. |

### E.6:4 - Solution — “On‑Ramp to Archetypes first, Authoring last” sequence

#### E.6:4.0 - Document order is distinct from first-practical entry

The macro-order of the document is a didactic scaffold, not a universal practical workflow. Entry navigation publication units such as `README`, `Preface`, ToC query cues, `E.11` entry-distribution loci, and `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation cases are informative navigation only: they may cross Parts when that is the first honest entry for the question under repair, and they do not create a second normative process history.

The "On-Ramp First" Macro-Structure: The specification is ordered to create a smooth cognitive ramp:
* It begins with an informal, non-normative Preface (The On-Ramp), which uses storytelling and concrete examples (System and Episteme) to build intuition.
* It then proceeds through the normative Parts (A-D), moving from the foundational kernel to the rich patterns of trans-disciplinary reasoning.
* It concludes with the authoring rules (Part E) and appendices, ensuring that this "meta" content does not obstruct the primary learning path.

1. **Preface (On‑Ramp)**
   Informal tour; introduces `U.System` and `U.Episteme` via concrete
   stories before any normative language appears.

2. **Part A Kernel**
   Minimal holonic ontology and acting-side externalization (A.12) give readers
   the essential vocabulary.

3. **Part B Trans‑disciplinary Reasoning**
   Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy: universal rule → Sys‑CAL example →
   KD‑CAL example.

4. **Part C Extension Patterns**
   Domain‑specific calculi expand on the examples already seen.

5. **Part D Ethics & Conflict Optimisation**
   Shows reflective patterns only after readers grasp holonic reasoning.

6. **Part E Authoring**
   Constitution, guard‑rails, and contributor rules come last; novices
   can postpone reading.

7. **Appendices (Annexes)**
   Tutorials, tooling guides, and migration scripts live here.

### E.6:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Narrative layer | First sight of `U.System` | First sight of `U.Episteme` |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Preface | Coffee‑machine story (pump as system). | Meta‑analysis story (study bundle as episteme). |
| Part A | Formal definition states the System criterion and applicable boundary conditions. | Formal definition states the Episteme criterion; F‑G‑R coordinates characterize a claim under the C.2.2 profile. |
| Part B Tell‑Show‑Show | Γ\_sys example: assemble pump. | Γ_epist example: merge study bundle. |

### E.6:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑DA.1** | Each Part **SHALL** open with a one‑paragraph situational “hook” before formal text. |
| **CC‑DA.2** | Every architectural pattern **MUST** implement Tell‑Show‑Show: universal rule plus System & Episteme illustrations. |
| **CC‑DA.3** | Governance patterns (**Part E**) **SHALL NOT** appear before the Kernel in the main document flow. |
| **CC‑DA.4** | Navigation aids **SHALL** distinguish document order from first-practical entry guidance; first-entry pattern-comparison guidance and expanded entry-disambiguation cases are informative and MAY cross Parts without implying a universal process history. |

### E.6:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Smooth learning curve; readers can stop at their needed depth. | Template discipline required; mitigated by authoring guide (E.8). |
| Reduces forward‑reference clutter; each concept is primed before formal use. | Preface evolves when new archetypes added; handled via On‑Ramp revision DRR. |

### E.6:8 - Rationale
Educational research shows retention improves when abstract rules are
immediately paired with contrasting illustrations. By fixing the reading
order and mandating Tell‑Show‑Show inside every architectural pattern, FPF
embeds pedagogy into its architecture, realising Pillars **P‑2 Didactic
Primacy** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** without weakening rigour.

### E.6:9 - Relations
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (GR‑1 ensures example jargon stays outside Core).
* **Constrains:** Placement of all Parts, patterns, and appendices.
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2
