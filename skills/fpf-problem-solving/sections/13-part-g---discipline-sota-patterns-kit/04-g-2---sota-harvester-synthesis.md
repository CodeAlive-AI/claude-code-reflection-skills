## G.2 - SoTA Harvester & Synthesis

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative *(unless explicitly marked informative)*
>
> **Purpose.** Provide a repeatable, auditable way to **discover**, **triage**, and **synthesize** state‑of‑the‑art (SoTA) across competing `Tradition` lineages *before* minting CHR/CAL/LOG assets for a `CG‑Frame`.
> The primary output is a **`SoTA Synthesis Pack@CG‑Frame`** that feeds:
>
> * naming/publication (UTS),
> * CHR authoring (G.3),
> * CAL authoring (G.4),
> * method/generator registries and dispatch (G.5).
>
> **Scope note.** This pattern **governs** the harvesting + synthesis *generator* in Part G. Use **G.10** to ship the pack and **G.11** to orchestrate refresh.
>
> **Terminology note (normative).** In normative clauses below, **`Tradition`** refers to the *Tech* token `Tradition` (a plural lineage with internally coherent commitments). Plain “tradition” is allowed only as a 1:1 synonym.

### G.2:1 - Problem frame

A team extends FPF into a new `CG‑Frame`. The relevant literature is typically:

* **plural** (multiple `Tradition` lineages with incompatible commitments),
* **source- and use-sensitive** (results depend on the exact source and edition, claim region, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, evidence, and receiving use),
* **method‑heterogeneous** (different evidence styles, operator sets, and validity regions),
* **time‑sensitive** (rapid drift post‑2015; frequent benchmark/protocol shifts).

Downstream Part-G work in CHR, CAL, selection, shipping, and refresh depends on citation-ready claims that keep each exact CG-frame, source edition, claim region, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, evidence anchor, and actual cross-source relation recoverable.

### G.2:2 - Problem

How can we systematically assemble a SoTA view that is:

1. **pluralist but comparable** (plurality preserved; comparability is achieved only via explicit crossings),
2. **evidence‑addressable** (claims cite auditable evidence surfaces and anchors),
3. **actionable** (produces inventories and citable publication forms usable in G.3, G.4, and G.5 without treating a card as a meaning container or selector authority),
4. **refreshable** (editions/policies/windows are pinned so RSCR/refresh can re‑audit and re‑run without semantic drift)?

### G.2:3 - Forces

* **Pluralism vs. consolidation.** Consolidation is valuable, but unqualified fusion destroys meaning.
* **Breadth vs. load‑bearing depth.** Too broad becomes shallow; too deep misses rival lineages.
* **Recency vs. stability.** Freshness matters, yet durable “backbone” claims must be identified and kept visible.
* **Pedagogy vs. rigour.** Outputs must be teachable enough to support review, while remaining audit‑ready.
* **Authoring vs. operations.** This pattern governs authoring; use the applicable Work and decision patterns for operational runs and decisions.

### G.2:4 - Solution

#### G.2:4.1 - G.Core linkage (normative)

**Builds on:** `G.Core` (Part‑G core invariants; citation/delegation hub)

**GCoreLinkageManifest (normative).**
*(Canonical form, Nil‑elision, and Expansion rule are defined in `G.Core`.)*

```text
GCoreLinkageManifest := ⟨
  CoreConformanceProfileIds := {
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.AuthoringBase,
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.UTSWhenPublicIdsMinted
  },
  RSCRTriggerSetIds := {GCoreTriggerSetId.SoTAHarvestSynthesis},
  CorePinSetIds := {GCorePinSetId.PartG.CrossingVisibilityPins},

  CorePinsRequired := {
    // Scope pins (G.2‑specific)
    CGFrameId, // identifies the exact CG-frame, which is the declared framing episteme; its cited ClaimGraph keeps source and edition, claim regions, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, and intended use recoverable
    Tradition[],
    entityOfConcern := ⟨GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane⟩,
    SoTA_SetId,
    SoTAPaletteDescriptionId,

    // Evidence / provenance pins (G.2‑specific)
    CorpusLedgerId,
    FlowRecordId,
    EvidenceAnchorRef[],
    EvidenceGraphId?,

    // Crossing / synthesis pins (delta beyond CorePinSetIds; only when used)
    GammaEpistSynthId[]?,

    // Edition / policy pins (only when used)
    HarvestPolicyRef?,
    DistanceDefRef.edition?,
    InclusionCriteriaId?,
    ScreeningRubricId?
  },

  DefaultsConsumed := ∅,
  TriggerAliasMapRef := ∅
⟩
```

*(RSCR payload pins: `ClaimSheetId[]`, `SoTA_SetId`, `SoTAPaletteDescriptionId`, `BridgeMatrixId?`, `GammaEpistSynthId[]?`, `UTSRowId[]?`, `DistanceDefRef.edition?`, `HarvestPolicyRef?`, `InclusionCriteriaId?`, `ScreeningRubricId?`, `PathId/PathSliceId?` when path‑citable evidence or a stable freshness window is pinned.)*

**Pattern‑local default rules (governed by this pattern; not a Part‑G‑wide `DefaultId`).**

`FamilyCoverageFloorK := 3` *(unless explicitly overridden by `HarvestPolicyRef` and recorded in `FlowRecord`)*

#### G.2:4.2 - Kit: `SoTA Synthesis Pack@CG‑Frame` (surface governed by this pattern)

A conforming `G.2` publication produces a **notation‑independent pack** whose internal organisation is free, but whose exported **named components and views** are stable and citable:

Each named component is addressable via a stable **pack‑local identifier** (e.g., `CorpusLedgerId`, `ClaimSheetId`, `FlowRecordId`) for citation and RSCR scoping. If any component is minted/evolved as a **public id**, it is published and cited via `UTSRowId[]` per `CC‑GCORE‑UTS‑1` (delegation).

0. **`SoTA_Set@CG‑Frame`** *(export view; “M2 output” consumed downstream)*
   A read‑optimised view over the harvested candidate set that downstream generator/selector work treats as the “harvester output set”.
   **Constraint (normative):** `SoTA_Set@CG‑Frame` **MUST** be reconstructible from pack components by id (no “hidden extra set”).

1. **`G.2a CorpusLedger`**
   Ledger of candidate sources. Each row names the exact source and edition, claim region used, triage status (for example, include, park, or retire), evidence locator, and rationale for this CG-frame and receiving use.

2. **`G.2b ClaimSheets[Tradition]`**
   Typed Claim Sheets per `Tradition`, each with:

   * exact source and edition, claim region, effective ReferenceScheme where meaning matters, EntityOfConcern, and comparison basis for the stated use,
   * explicit evidence anchors/citations (A.10 and/or EvidenceGraph refs when available),
   * explicit freshness window notes and risk/trust cues *(cite `B.3` governing definitions when using trust/decay language)*.

3. **`G.2c OperatorAndObjectInventory`**
   Inventory of candidate CHR terms (characteristics/scales/coordinates) and candidate CAL operators/flows *as stubs* for downstream authoring.

4. **`G.2d BridgeMatrix`**
   A citable alignment/divergence surface across `Tradition`×`Tradition`, with explicit losses and row scopes.
   If any row asserts substitution or fusion across sources or across `Tradition` records, the pack **MUST** attach a `GammaEpistSynthId` record (alias: **`G.2‑F`**) per `G.2:Ext.GammaEpistSynthesis` (no silent fusion).

5. **`G.2e MicroExamples`**
   Worked micro-examples for load-bearing claims. Each names the exact source and edition, claim region, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, and intended use; cites its evidence carrier or A.10 evidence-provenance path; and annotates applicable assurance types (`TA`, `VA`, or `LA`). The example card is only a publication form for those claims.

6. **`G.2f UTSProposals`**
   Draft Name Cards + Minimal Definitional Sheets (MDS) + alias proposals (incl. concept‑set linkage where applicable), with the required publication pins.

7. **`G.2g entityOfConcern Map`**
   Map from key terms/claims/public ids to `GroundingHolon`, `ReferencePlane`, and minimal reference cues for later CHR/CAL authoring.

8. **`G.2h PRISMA Flow Record`**
   A screening/eligibility trail for how sources entered the pack (method‑profile is allowed; see Extensions).
   *(Name is historical; the artefact remains notation‑independent.)*

9. **`G.2i SoSIndicatorFamilies`**
   Indicator *families* as variants (windows/constraints/assumptions) **with explicit Acceptance branches per variant** (branch ids/labels only; threshold semantics belong to CAL governing definitions).

10. **`G.2j MethodFamilyCards`**
    Candidate method families with a shared signature and a plurality of implementations, each with validity regions, cost/complexity notes, and known failure modes.
    When the pack targets downstream registry/dispatch, MethodFamily cards **SHOULD** include the declared refs and pins `G.5` needs (eligibility predicate refs, assurance profile cues, and the pack ids that justify the family).

11. **`G.2k GeneratorFamilyCards`** *(if applicable)*
    Candidate generator families for environment/task generation with declared validity regions and transfer hooks.

12. **`G.2l Annexes`** *(optional; governing-definition-cited; see Extensions)*
    For example: QD/NQD annexes, discipline‑specific indicator annexes, interop forms.

**SoTAPaletteDescription** *(export view; required downstream)*
A view‑friendly description object (pack‑local `SoTAPaletteDescriptionId`) that binds together:

* the `SoTA_Set@CG‑Frame` view,
* `ClaimSheetId[]`, `OperatorAndObjectInventory`, `BridgeMatrixId?`,
* `SoSIndicatorFamilies` (with variant/branch structure),
* `MethodFamilyCards` / `GeneratorFamilyCards?`,
* `MicroExamples`, `UTSProposals`,
* and the `entityOfConcern Map` for citation and later CHR/CAL authoring.

**Note (normative intent):** this is the primary “consumable surface” for `G.3/G.4/G.5`; it prevents downstream patterns from scraping free prose.

**Editorial template: 1‑page “SoTA Sheet” per Tradition (informative).**
When authoring `ClaimSheets[Tradition]`, teams often benefit from a single‑page template: scope + claims + evidence anchors + validity region + failure modes + freshness window + cross‑Tradition reuse notes + pointers to micro‑examples.

#### G.2:4.3 - Harvester loop (conceptual choreography; pattern-governed)

A conforming `G.2` pack publication is built by iterating the following conceptual loop until the declared gates are satisfied:

1. **Declare scope and plurality.**
   Identify the exact CG-frame (the declared framing episteme), the initial `Tradition` set, each intended claim region and EntityOfConcern, the comparison basis, and the receiving use. Record the cited CG-frame and source editions and evidence anchors in the pack pins rather than hiding them in a generic context field.

2. **Discover and triage sources (ledger‑first).**
   Populate `CorpusLedger` via:

   * adding seed sources,
   * expansion via citation chaining and keyword family exploration,
   * pruning using load‑bearing relevance tests tied to the declared CG‑Frame scope.

3. **Distill claims per `Tradition`.**
   For each `Tradition`, author a Claim Sheet that preserves internal commitments and cites evidence anchors. Do not fuse cross‑`Tradition` claims at this stage.

4. **Inventory operators/objects for downstream authoring.**
   Extract candidate measurement terms and operator stubs for later CHR/CAL authoring (without asserting legality or thresholds locally).

5. **Build alignment/divergence surfaces.**
   Where reuse across `Tradition` is desired, author Bridge‑backed alignment records and explicit loss notes in `BridgeMatrix`. Any consolidation is explicitly marked as requiring alignment proof.

6. **(Alias: G.2‑F) Produce Γ_epist synthesis records when fusion/substitution is asserted.**
   If a `G.2` pack publication asserts fusion or substitution across sources or across `Tradition` records (beyond mere “parallel divergent claims”), it **MUST** emit `GammaEpistSynthId` records per `G.2:Ext.GammaEpistSynthesis` (provenance union + explicit object alignment refs + assurance tuple refs), and it **MUST** keep penalties routed to `R_eff` only by delegation (`CC‑GCORE‑PEN‑1`).

7. **Publish teachable micro‑groundings.**
   Attach worked micro-examples to load-bearing claims, each tied to the exact source and edition, claim region, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, intended use, and evidence carrier or A.10 evidence-provenance path.

8. **Apply gates and record repairs.**
   Enforce `FamilyCoverageFloorK` (and any optional diversity‑by‑distance gate). If a gate fails, the pack **MUST**:
   * record the failure and the repair iteration in `FlowRecord` and `CorpusLedger`,
   * pin the updated `HarvestPolicyRef` / criteria ids (if changed),
   * iterate the loop rather than silently weakening the gate.

9. **Emit hand‑off manifests and export views.**
   Produce explicit manifests to:

   * `G.3` (CHR authoring),
   * `G.4` (CAL authoring),
   * `G.5` (registry/dispatch),

   so that downstream work can cite pack components by id rather than re‑authoring them.
   The pack **MUST** also export `SoTA_Set@CG‑Frame` and `SoTAPaletteDescription` as the default downstream consumption surfaces (ids pinned).

#### G.2:4.4 - Interfaces (minimal I/O Standard)

| Interface         | Consumes                                                      | Produces                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G.2-1 Harvest** | exact CG-frame (the declared framing episteme) identified by `CGFrameId`, initial `Tradition[]`, source edition and claim-region boundary, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, receiving use, `HarvestPolicyRef?` | `SoTA Synthesis Pack@CG-Frame` (G.2a-G.2l) |
| **G.2‑2 Extend**  | existing Pack + new sources/anchors + updated policy pins     | updated Pack + RSCR‑relevant trigger emissions (canonical kinds)            |
| **G.2‑3 HandOff** | Pack                                                          | `CHR‑handoff` (to G.3), `CAL‑handoff` (to G.4), `Registry‑handoff` (to G.5) |

*Note:* Orchestration of re‑runs is governed by `G.11`; this pattern only defines what a conforming (re)harvest produces and what pins it must expose.

#### G.2:4.5 - Extensions (pattern‑scoped; non‑core)

`Extensions` are pattern‑scoped annexes. They do not introduce Part‑G‑wide norms; they declare the additional pins required when those semantics are active and cite the corresponding governing patterns.

###### G.2:4.5.1 - GPatternExtension: GammaEpistSynthesis

**PatternScopeId:** `G.2:Ext.GammaEpistSynthesis`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `GammaEpistSynthesis`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `GeneratorSpecific`
**GoverningPatternId:** `G.2`
**Uses:** `{G.Core, B.3, F.9, G.6}` *(penalty routing + trust/decay cues + bridges/CL + evidence path citation when used)*
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins/EditionPins/PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `GammaEpistSynthId[]` *(pack‑local ids of synthesis records; emitted iff fusion/substitution is asserted)*
* `EvidenceAnchorRef[]` *(provenance union; evidence carriers cited by A.10 evidence-provenance paths)*
* `BridgeMatrixId` and `BridgeCardId[]` *(explicit object alignment references when crossing is involved)*
* `CL/CL^plane` + `Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane policy-ids` *(ids only; semantics governed by cited definitions; penalties → `R_eff` only by delegation)*
* `PathId/PathSliceId?` *(only when citing via `G.6`)*

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.CrossingBundleEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.ReferencePlaneEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.PenaltyPolicyEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange}`

**Notes (normative intent; duplication‑avoidant):**
* `Γ_epist^synth` is an auditable record that binds: (i) provenance union, (ii) explicit object alignment refs, (iii) assurance tuple refs (via existing governing definitions) for each asserted fusion/substitution.
* This extension **does not** redefine `Γ‑fold`, `Φ`, or penalty semantics; it only requires the pins/refs needed for replayability and auditability (see `G.Core` delegations).

###### G.2:4.5.2 - GPatternExtension: HarvestProtocols

**PatternScopeId:** `G.2:Ext.HarvestProtocols`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `HarvestProtocols`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `Phase3Seed`
**GoverningPatternId:** `G.2`
**Uses:** `{B.3, A.10}` *(for freshness/decay and provenance anchors, when protocol requires them explicitly)*
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins/EditionPins/PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `HarvestPolicyRef` *(declares the chosen protocol family and its parameters)*
* `FlowRecordId` *(protocol‑specific profile id or rubric id may be attached here)*
* `InclusionCriteriaId` / `ScreeningRubricId` *(ids only; semantics remain local to the protocol family)*

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent}`

**Notes (extension discipline):**
* This extension binds a declared protocol profile to the pack’s `FlowRecord` without redefining evidence semantics.

###### G.2:4.5.3 - GPatternExtension: DHCAlignmentHooks

**PatternScopeId:** `G.2:Ext.DHCAlignmentHooks`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `DHCAlignmentHooks`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `DisciplineSpecific`
**GoverningPatternId:** `C.21` *(DHC semantics are governed by C.21)*
**Uses:** `{C.21, G.6, G.7}` *(DHC series + evidence path citations + bridge/CL regimes when alignment density is claimed)*
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins/EditionPins/PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `DHCMethodRef.edition`
* `WindowRef?` *(if the DHC series is windowed)*
* exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` refs used by the DHC comparison set (use `SenseCellAddressRef` where a durable address is needed; cite `UTSRowId[]` only for independently public ids)
* `UTSRowId[]?` *(only if a cited cell or series id is independently minted or evolved as a public id)*
* `PathId[]` / `PathSliceId[]` *(when alignment summaries cite evidence paths via G.6)*

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta}`

**Notes (extension discipline):**
* If DHC alignment summaries are emitted, this extension ensures the DHC method edition and the cited evidence paths are visible.
* Units and constraints governed by `C.21` are pinned, not redefined here: for example `bridges_per_100_cells`, the exact F.17 cell comparison set, exact F.9 Bridge refs, `CL_min = 2`, and the stated interpretation of `CL=3` when used. The count is over named cells and obtaining relations, not contexts.

###### G.2:4.5.4 - GPatternExtension: NQDAnnex

**PatternScopeId:** `G.2:Ext.NQDAnnex`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `NQDAnnex`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `MethodSpecific`
**GoverningPatternId:** `C.18` *(NQD-CAL semantics are governed by C.18; explore/exploit logging is governed by C.19 when used)*
**Uses:** `{C.18, C.19}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins/EditionPins/PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `DescriptorMapRef.edition`
* `DistanceDefRef.edition`
* `InsertionPolicyRef` *(policy‑id/ref)*
* `EmitterPolicyRef` *(policy‑id/ref)*
* `TaskSignatureRef?` *(when QD mode is trait‑gated)*

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent}`

**Notes (extension discipline):**
* This extension only pins the required references for replayability; it does not redefine QD semantics, dominance, or acceptance rules.

###### G.2:4.5.5 - GPatternExtension: InteropForms

**PatternScopeId:** `G.2:Ext.InteropForms`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `InteropForms`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `InteropSpecific`
**GoverningPatternId:** `G.13`
**Uses:** `{G.13}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins/EditionPins/PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `ExternalIndexRef.edition`
* `ClaimMapperRef.edition`
* `MappingPolicyRef` *(policy‑id/ref)*
* `UTSRowId[]` *(for published external ids/aliases where relevant)*

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TokenizationOrNameChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit}`

**Notes (extension discipline):**
* Interop affects only representation and citation routes; it must not introduce alternate legality gates or acceptance semantics.

#### G.2:4.6 - Palette first

- `SoTAPaletteDescription` is one plurality-preserving palette.
- It is not by itself one `Front`, one `Archive`, or one `Shortlist`.
- When that palette's members are traditions, `TraditionPalette` is the reader-facing tradition-only palette head over the same palette declaration, not one second governing definition. For methods, hypotheses, or other members, keep `SoTAPaletteDescription` or `Palette + SubjectKind` explicit instead.
- Traditions remain in the palette until a later surface declares comparison, retention, or choice semantics explicitly.
- `TraditionFront` is one derived view over the declared palette under one declared `Q`; the `Q` basis stays pinned separately and the view does not rename `Tradition` or `SoTAPaletteDescription`.
- `TraditionArchive` is one derived retention view over that same palette under one declared reachability or coverage rule; that rule stays pinned separately and the view does not turn the palette into one archive by default.
- When one derived tradition view is shown, keep the base palette recoverable at the same time.
- When comparison or retention needs richer geometry or atlas language, treat that as support for the derivation rather than as the default meaning of the palette.
- A reader should be able to say both `this is the palette` and `this is the derived tradition view currently being shown` without collapsing those two objects.

#### G.2:4.7 - Atlas views stay optional neighboring interpretation over one declared palette and declared set results

- `TraditionAtlasView` is one declared optional neighboring interpretive view over one palette and any declared front, archive, or shortlist surfaces drawn from it, while the cited substrate-bearing line, the active source set or active set result, and any cited `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, or other declared space refs remain recoverable.
- `TraditionAtlasView` is the `G.2` use-site specialization of `DeclaredSubstrateAtlasView`; keep the generic interpretive-view declaration in `A.19.DECLARED-SUBSTRATE-INTERPRETIVE-VIEW`.
- It is not the default meaning of `Tradition` or `SoTAPaletteDescription`.
- Stay palette-first when the harvest or synthesis question can already be judged from the declared palette together with ordinary front, archive, or shortlist surfaces.
- Use `TraditionAtlasView` only when the reader must hold several declared derived views or interpretive qualifiers together to see why one tradition grouping, omission risk, or comparison boundary matters.
- A conforming `TraditionAtlasView` must keep the same atlas-form interpretation declaration that `A.19.DECLARED-SUBSTRATE-INTERPRETIVE-VIEW` requires by value: recoverable base palette, active source set or active set result, `TypedSetViews` when several declared set views are held together, cited `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, or other declared space refs, cited declared map refs such as `OutcomeMapRef`, cited qualifiers such as `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionRelationRef`, and `BridgeDistortionNote`, and one explicit reason why thinner `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` is insufficient here.
- It may help explain where one tradition, method family, or retained line sits relative to another, but it should not silently redefine the base palette or one derived front view or archive view.
- If one atlas view uses several typed views over the same source set, keep the active set result, any cited `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, or other declared space ref, and any `BridgeDistortionNote` recoverable instead of letting `TraditionAtlasView` hide those choices.
- Treat the atlas layer as optional neighboring interpretation, not as ordinary palette-first core. Use `SpaceMetricRef` or `TransitionRelationRef` only when one declared comparison, reachability, transition, or cross-scale state-change claim actually depends on that formal support; otherwise leave them unstated.
- Use `OutcomeMapRef` only when the atlas must show how one declared set result maps into one outcome-side or effect-side declared space/ref; it does not turn the palette, front, archive, or shortlist into that outcome-side declared space/ref.
- If one atlas reading would materially change the base source-to-outcome relation or distortion posture, reopen the substrate declaration instead of treating that change as one local `G.2` convenience.
- If one thinner `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` already keeps the question legible, prefer that thinner interpretation form and leave atlas specialization unused.
- `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` doctrine, transition-aware novelty, metric-transfer loss, and cross-scale geometry belong to a heavier formal layer: keep them outside ordinary palette-first use unless the current comparison, reachability, transition, or multilevel claim explicitly needs them, and do not pull them in merely because one richer comparative reading is mathematically available.
- If no declared atlas view is needed, stay with the simpler palette-first and declared-derived-view surfaces.
- Different atlas views may rely on different declared spaces, metrics, bridges, or transition supports; keep that plurality visible rather than forcing one geometry monoculture across every neighboring view.
- If several mathematical traditions remain plausible, keep that plurality visible rather than pretending the atlas already fixes one final formalism.
- If the question is naming-side only, use `F.18` for that wording choice rather than letting atlas-form interpretation language carry the naming decision by itself.

| **Tell** | A safety engineering team needs to choose a control stack across robust-control, learning-based, and formal-verification lineages. It identifies the exact CG-frame (the declared framing episteme), vehicle and operating-envelope EntityOfConcern, source editions, claim regions, test or comparison basis, evidence anchors, and intended decision use. | A research group synthesizes SoTA on decision quality across named causal, evidential, bounded-rationality, and active-inference lineages, keeping each source edition, local claim, evidence norm, comparison basis, and intended research use explicit. |
| **Show (failure)** | The team merges source-local terms, treats incompatible test protocols and populations as comparable, and collapses partially ordered trade-offs into one unqualified score. A later safety review cannot recover which source, claim region, basis, or evidence supported the choice. | The group publishes one “best” metric and retrofits definitions to it. Conflicting claims cannot be traced because source editions, evidence anchors, comparison bases, and any actual cross-source relation were never made explicit. |
| **Show (repair)** | Keep parallel Claim Sheets with exact sources, editions, claim regions, EntitiesOfConcern, comparison bases, and evidence. Cite an F.9 Bridge and loss only for an actual relation. Authors of CHR, CAL, and selection methods can then use the citable claims without attributing authority to a card. | Preserve plural claims, represent indicators as families or variants, and expose freshness and evidence. Any justified alignment names its exact cells and obtaining relation; the card or matrix merely represents that result. |

### G.2:6 - Bias-Annotation (informative)

Bias lenses: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: harvesting and synthesis for a `CG‑Frame`.

* **Selection bias (Gov/Onto).** Any harvesting protocol can over‑represent certain venues, languages, or evidence styles.
  *Mitigation:* pluralism floor + explicit `CorpusLedger` + explicit protocol pins.

* **Consolidation bias (Onto/Epist).** Pressure to “merge” lineages can erase incompatible commitments.
  *Mitigation:* keep Claim Sheets disjoint by default; require explicit alignment proof for fusion; preserve loss notes.

* **Recency bias (Prag).** Overweighting newest papers can hide durable backbone results; underweighting them misses SoTA drift.
  *Mitigation:* publish freshness windows and make them RSCR‑relevant.

* **Didactic bias (Did).** Micro‑examples can steer interpretation toward familiar domains.
  *Mitigation:* require heterogeneous substrates and explicit A.10 anchors.

### G.2:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative) — **CC‑G2**

| ConformanceId             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Purpose / Notes                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑G2‑CoreRef**         | A conforming `G.2` artefact **MUST** satisfy the **effective** core obligations declared by the `GCoreLinkageManifest` in `G.2:4.1` (per `G.Core` Expansion rule).                                                                                                                                                                                 | Keeps core invariants governed by `G.Core`. |
| **CC-G2-Pluralism-1** | A conforming pack MUST include at least two `Tradition` lineages and at least three materially distinct entries, each identified by its source edition and claim region, with its EntityOfConcern, evidence norm, and comparison limits visible. | Prevents a single lineage or one renamed source cut from masquerading as synthesis. |
| **CC‑G2‑Ledger‑1**        | A conforming pack **MUST** include `G.2a CorpusLedger` with inclusion/triage status and explicit rationale hooks per entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Makes discovery/triage auditable.                                                   |
| **CC‑G2‑FlowRecord‑1**    | A conforming pack **MUST** include `G.2h FlowRecord` that traces identification → screening → eligibility → included at a minimum granularity sufficient to reproduce the corpus boundary.                                                                                                                                                         | Prevents “mystery inclusion” and supports refresh.                                  |
| **CC-G2-ClaimSheets-1** | For each included `Tradition`, the pack MUST include a `ClaimSheetId` naming exact sources and editions, claim regions, effective schemes where meaning matters, EntitiesOfConcern, comparison bases, evidence anchors, freshness notes, and intended use; it MUST NOT fuse cross-`Tradition` claims by default. | Keeps plurality and provenance explicit without a Context container. |
| **CC‑G2‑Palette‑1**       | A conforming pack **MUST** export `SoTA_Set@CG‑Frame` and `SoTAPaletteDescription` as citable views (via `SoTA_SetId`, `SoTAPaletteDescriptionId`) and ensure both are reconstructible from pack components by id (no hidden extra structure).                                                                                                      | Prevents downstream scraping of prose; keeps “M2 output” explicit.                  |
| **CC‑G2‑Palette‑2**       | If the pack exports one derived tradition view such as `TraditionFront` or `TraditionArchive`, it **MUST** keep `SoTAPaletteDescription` explicit as the default base palette, keep that derivation recoverable, and cite the declared `Q` or reachability/coverage rule that disciplined that view. Derived tradition views **MUST NOT** silently replace the palette's default meaning. | Keeps non-default tradition views recoverable without redefining palette-first semantics. |
| **CC‑G2‑AtlasInterpretation‑1**  | If the pack exports `TraditionAtlasView`, it **MUST** satisfy the same interpretive-view declaration required by `A.19.DECLARED-SUBSTRATE-INTERPRETIVE-VIEW`: keep the base palette and active source set or active set result recoverable, name `TypedSetViews` when several declared set views are held together, cite any active `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, or other declared space refs, cite any active `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionRelationRef`, or `BridgeDistortionNote` only when they do real explanatory work, state why thinner `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` is insufficient here, and **MUST NOT** use atlas form when palette-first or thinner `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` is sufficient. | Keeps the `G.2` specialization at least as constraining as the general `DeclaredSubstrateAtlasView` declaration and preserves space-role recoverability. |
| **CC‑G2‑entityOfConcernMap‑1** | A conforming pack **MUST** include `G.2g entityOfConcern Map`, mapping (at minimum) each load‑bearing claim family and each minted/evolved public id to `entityOfConcern := ⟨GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane⟩`, and citing the relevant `ClaimSheetId` and evidence anchors (A.10 and/or G.6 paths when used).                                         | Keeps plane/holon boundaries explicit and citable.                                  |
| **CC‑G2‑Alignment‑1**     | Any cross‑`Tradition` consolidation **SHALL** be presented as either (i) disjoint parallel claims with explicit divergence, or (ii) an explicitly justified alignment proof; any reuse across `Tradition` boundaries **MUST** use explicit crossing bundles per `CC‑GCORE‑CROSS‑1` (delegation).                                                  | Prevents silent semantic leakage.                                                   |
| **CC‑G2‑GammaSynth‑1**    | If the pack asserts **fusion or substitution** across sources or across `Tradition` records (not merely “parallel divergent claims”), it **MUST** emit `GammaEpistSynthId` records satisfying `G.2:Ext.GammaEpistSynthesis` (provenance union + explicit alignment refs + assurance tuple refs). If no fusion or substitution is asserted, the pack **SHALL** state so explicitly. | Keeps the synthesis record (alias: `G.2‑F`) citable under its governing definitions. |
| **CC‑G2‑Inventory‑1**     | A conforming pack **MUST** include `G.2c OperatorAndObjectInventory`, sufficient for downstream CHR/CAL authoring to begin without re‑harvesting terms.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Ensures the pack is actionable.                                                     |
| **CC‑G2‑Inventory‑2**     | `G.2c OperatorAndObjectInventory` entries **MUST** be treated as **stubs** for downstream authoring: they **MUST NOT** embed acceptance thresholds or claim legality decisions locally. If an entry is not a citation of an already governed CHR/CAL artefact, it **MUST** be explicitly marked as `stub` (typing/lawfulness `TBD`) and **MUST NOT** be used as if lawful. Legality/threshold semantics are governed by `G.3` for CHR and `G.4` for CAL via explicit ids/pins. | Prevents “shadow CHR/CAL” and preserves lawfulness discipline without redefining it locally. |
| **CC‑G2‑MeasurementLawful‑1** | If any inventory entry is presented as **non‑stub** (i.e., already lawful/typed), the pack **MUST** cite the governing lawfulness discipline (e.g., `A.17–A.19/C.16` as applicable) and provide the minimal evidence anchors needed to justify that typing claim.                                                                                      | Prevents “quietly lawful” measurement claims inside the harvester pack.             |
| **CC-G2-MicroExamples-1** | For every load-bearing claim family, a conforming pack MUST include at least two worked micro-examples on heterogeneous substrates. Each names the source and edition, claim region, EntityOfConcern, comparison basis, and intended use; cites its evidence carrier or A.10 evidence-provenance path; and gives an applicable assurance tag. | Makes the synthesis teachable and inspectable; the example form supplies no meaning or authority. |
| **CC‑G2‑UTS‑1**           | If the pack proposes or evolves any public ids, it **MUST** publish UTS proposals *(Name Cards + MDS where applicable)* and cite them via `UTSRowId[]`, satisfying `CC‑GCORE‑UTS‑1` (delegation).                                                                                                                                               | Keeps naming and evolution disciplined.                                             |
| **CC‑G2‑Families‑1**      | SoS indicators and candidate evaluation constructs **SHALL** be represented as **families/variants** (windows/constraints/assumptions) **with explicit Acceptance branch structure per variant** (branch ids/labels only), not as single unqualified scalars; any scalar summary **MAY** be included only as report‑only unless explicitly promoted by governing patterns. *(Set-return discipline is delegated to `CC‑GCORE‑SET‑1`.)* | Prevents covert scalarization and keeps acceptance governed by downstream patterns.                |
| **CC‑G2‑HandOff‑1**       | A conforming pack **MUST** emit hand‑off manifests to `G.3`, `G.4`, and `G.5` that cite pack components by id and identify which families/operators are intended for downstream formalisation or registry entry.                                                                                                                                   | Prevents downstream re‑authoring and drift.                                         |
| **CC‑G2‑CoverageGate‑1**  | The pack **MUST** declare `FamilyCoverageFloorK` and enforce it as a harvesting gate. It **MUST** either (i) specify `k` explicitly in an explicit `HarvestPolicyRef`, or (ii) use the pattern‑local default rule governed by `CC‑G2‑CoverageGate‑1`. *Default rule (pattern-local):* `k=3`. If the gate fails, the pack **MUST** (a) record the repair iteration in `FlowRecord`, and (b) broaden the search radius (new venues/corpora/contexts/traditions) rather than silently weakening the gate; if an exploration policy is used for this broadening, it **MUST** be pinned as a policy id/ref. | Makes “coverage floor” explicit and prevents “silent narrowing” under failure.      |
| **CC‑G2‑DistanceGate‑1**  | If a diversity‑by‑distance gate is used, the pack **MUST** pin `DistanceDefRef.edition` and the declared threshold (δ), and treat edits as RSCR‑relevant per `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑*` (delegation). If no such gate is used, the pack **SHALL** explicitly state that it is not used.                                                                     | Avoids implicit distance defaults and improves refreshability.                      |
| **CC‑G2‑RSCR‑1**          | A conforming pack **MUST** emit canonical `RSCRTriggerKindId` causes (not free text) for edits to evidence surfaces, name/tokenization surfaces (e.g., UTS proposals/aliases), crossings, planes, edition pins, and harvesting policy pins (`HarvestPolicyRef`), per `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑1…TRIG‑4` (delegation).                                                                                      | Keeps refresh reason codes stable and typed.                                        |
| **CC‑G2‑Ext‑GammaEpist‑1** | If `G.2:Ext.GammaEpistSynthesis` is used (i.e., any fusion/substitution is asserted), the pack **SHALL** expose the required pins listed in that extension and **SHALL NOT** redefine `Γ‑fold/Φ/penalty` semantics locally (cite governing definitions by delegation).                                                                                       | Keeps synthesis auditable without creating shadow specs.                            |
| **CC‑G2‑Ext‑HarvestProtocols‑1** | If `G.2:Ext.HarvestProtocols` is used, the pack **SHALL** expose the required pins/criteria ids listed in that extension and **SHALL NOT** redefine evidence/quality semantics outside the declared protocol profile.                                                                                                                            | Keeps protocol variation explicit and separately citable.                           |
| **CC-G2-Ext-DHC-1** | If `G.2:Ext.DHCAlignmentHooks` is used, the pack SHALL expose the DHC method edition, exact F.17 cell comparison set, exact F.9 relation refs actually counted, evidence paths, and C.21 unit and constraint pins such as `bridges_per_100_cells` and `CL_min=2`, without redefining them locally. | Keeps DHC counts tied to named cells and obtaining relations. |
| **CC‑G2‑Ext‑NQD‑1**       | If `G.2:Ext.NQDAnnex` is used, the pack **SHALL** expose the required pins/editions/policies listed in that extension and **SHALL NOT** redefine QD semantics locally.                                                                                                                                                                             | Keeps QD/OEE extension pins replayable and non‑shadowing.                          |
| **CC‑G2‑Ext‑Interop‑1**   | If `G.2:Ext.InteropForms` is used, the pack **SHALL** expose the required interop pins and **SHALL NOT** introduce alternative legality/acceptance semantics.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Prevents “foreign gate” shadowing.                                                  |

### G.2:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **AP‑G2‑1: “One true SoTA score.”**
  **Avoid:** selecting a single unqualified scalar metric as “the” SoTA.
  **Do instead:** represent evaluation constructs as families/variants; keep partial orders set‑returning (delegated).

* **AP‑G2‑2: Fusion without explicit alignment proof.**
  **Avoid:** merging rival `Tradition` claims into one statement “by common sense.”
  **Do instead:** preserve parallel Claim Sheets; if consolidation is required, publish explicit alignment proof or keep a divergence record.

* **AP‑G2‑3: Hidden protocol drift.**
  **Avoid:** changing the harvesting protocol (inclusion criteria, windowing, screening rubric) without pins.
  **Do instead:** pin harvesting policy/profile ids and treat changes as RSCR‑relevant.

* **AP‑G2‑4: Unanchored pedagogy.**
  **Avoid:** micro‑examples without carriers (they become folklore).
  **Do instead:** bind micro‑examples to A.10 anchors and declare `entityOfConcern`.

* **AP‑G2‑5: Atlas by default.**
  **Avoid:** writing as if every tradition comparison or NQD/OEE note needs `TraditionAtlasView`, or as if atlas wording renames the palette itself.
  **Do instead:** keep the base palette and derived front, archive, or shortlist explicit; use atlas form only when several declared views or interpretive qualifiers must be held together, and prefer thinner `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` when that is enough.

### G.2:9 - Consequences

* **Positive:** Downstream CHR/CAL/dispatch work becomes faster and less ambiguous because the pack is citable and structured.
* **Positive:** Plurality is preserved while still enabling disciplined comparability through explicit crossings.
* **Positive:** Refresh becomes tractable because pins and typed causes exist.
* **Negative:** Adds authoring overhead (ledger, flow record, micro‑examples, explicit pins).
* **Negative:** Requires governance discipline to prevent the pack from becoming an uncontrolled “everything bucket”.

### G.2:10 - Rationale

SoTA synthesis is a bottleneck for new `CG‑Frame` work: without a disciplined harvest, downstream formalization (CHR/CAL) and operational selection (G.5) either (i) inherit hidden semantic collisions, or (ii) re‑invent incompatible “mini‑standards.”
`G.2` resolves this by treating SoTA work as a **publishable kit**: explicit plurality, explicit crossings, explicit evidence anchors, and explicit hand‑offs.

### G.2:11 - SoTA-Echoing (informative)

This pattern aligns its *method options* (via Extensions and authoring practice) with widely used post‑2015 SoTA practices, while keeping FPF’s semantics stable and id‑based:

1. **PRISMA 2020 reporting discipline** (Page et al., 2021)
   *Status:* **Adopt (adapted)** — we adopt the idea of a transparent screening trail as `FlowRecord`, but keep it notation‑independent and concept‑level.

2. **Living systematic reviews** (Elliott et al., 2017 and subsequent living‑review practice)
   *Status:* **Adopt (as optional protocol family)** — the “living” stance is expressed as a harvesting protocol profile (Extension), with explicit freshness windows and RSCR‑relevant change causes.

3. **AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal** (Shea et al., 2017)
   *Status:* **Adapt** — we adapt the idea of structured quality appraisal into Claim Sheet evidence cues, without turning it into a single scalar rating.

4. **Science of Science synthesis** (Fortunato et al., 2018)
   *Status:* **Adopt (as content discipline)** — SoS indicators are treated as families/variants and wired as citable artefacts, not as a single “score”.

5. **Disruption / team‑structure indicators** (Wu, Wang & Evans, 2019 and follow‑on work)
   *Status:* **Adopt (as exemplar family)** — useful as an example of a SoS‑indicator family with material dependence on windowing and corpus definition.

6. **Quality‑Diversity and open‑ended generation** (e.g., Fontaine et al., 2020 for CMA‑ME; Wang et al., 2019 for POET)
   *Status:* **Adopt (as optional annex with explicit pin declarations)** — when QD/OEE is relevant for the `CG‑Frame`, we include generator/method family cards and pin the required edition/policy surfaces via `G.2:Ext.NQDAnnex`, without embedding those semantics into the core pack.

### G.2:12 - Relations

* **Builds on:**

  * `G.Core` (core invariants, typed RSCR causes, Default Governing Definition Index)
  * `E.8` (pattern template discipline)
  * `E.10` (lexical/ontological rules; strict distinction; kind‑suffix discipline)
  * `E.19` (conformance discipline)
  * `A.10` (evidence-provenance paths and cited source/carrier anchors)
  * `A.19.DECLARED-SUBSTRATE-INTERPRETIVE-VIEW` (generic interpretive-view and atlas discipline when `TraditionAtlasView` is used)
  * `A.6.P` (space/view/publication precision restoration when palette/support claims collapse)
  * `B.3` (trust, freshness/decay as cited governing patterns)
  * `F.9` (bridges and CL as cited governing patterns)
  * `F.17` (UTS publication discipline; via delegation)
  * `G.0` (CG‑Spec legality gate; cited when legality surfaces are referenced)
  * `G.6` (EvidenceGraph / path citation surfaces when used)

* **Used by:**

  * `G.1` (generator chassis consumes harvested SoTA sets)
  * `G.3` (CHR authoring consumes operator/object inventory and claim sheets)
  * `G.4` (CAL authoring consumes operator stubs, acceptance branch scaffolding)
  * `G.5` (registry/dispatch consumes MethodFamily/GeneratorFamily cards)
  * `G.10` (shipping cites the pack as payload)
  * `G.11` (refresh orchestration can re‑invoke harvest via typed causes)

* **Relates to:**

  * `G.13` (interop surfaces when external indices are used)
  * `F.18` (naming-side support wording when the question is label choice rather than synthesis geometry)
