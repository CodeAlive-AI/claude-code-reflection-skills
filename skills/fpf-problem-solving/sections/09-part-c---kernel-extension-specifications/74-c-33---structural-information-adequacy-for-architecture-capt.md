## C.33 - Structural Information Adequacy for Architecture Capture and Missing-Structure Return

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.33:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an architect has a description, view, decision record, ADR-like projection, eval report, method handoff, generated relation graph, source model, or realized holon observation that carries or describes selected architecture-relevant structure and needs to know which selected structure is actually recoverable for the next architecture use.

Use the same pattern when the carrier is a narrative rendering or principle-framework publication for architecture work: the carrier may preserve a problem-to-structure ordering, problem-situation architecture, solution-move architecture, candidate trade-off, decision rationale, or missing-structure cue, but it may also hide selected structures that the next architecture use still needs. In architecture-mediated rendering, inspect the chain from carrier to architecture description or view, then to the described holon and its architecture-relevant selected structures in context, then to wider selected source structures, because each relation may have captured and lost different structure.

Primary working reader: an architect, architecture reviewer, method steward, or AI-assisted architecture worker who must use one carrier or observation without letting it stand for the whole architecture, the project decision, evidence sufficiency, or realized structure.

Typical entry phrases:

```text
"This view is useful, but what structure does it actually capture?"
"The ADR says what was decided; which selected structures and hidden losses does it leave behind?"
"The code-agent map found dependencies and invariants; can we rely on them for architecture work?"
"The neural-network architecture review names attention, cache, router, and pruning; what FPF structures are recoverable?"
"The operation observation shows the real system diverged; what actual structure is visible enough to return to synthesis?"
```

The first useful output is `StructuralInformationAdequacyNote@Context`. It is a project-side adequacy note for one declared architecture use. It is not a C.16 characteristic, not a measurement, not an evidence record, not an assurance result, not a project decision, and not an architecture description by itself.

For the first pass, fill only the fields that prevent the next wrong use:

```text
StructuralInformationAdequacyNote@Context:
  architectureClaimRef?:
  describedHolonRef:
  architectureConcern:
  intendedArchitectureUse:
  claimScopeRef?: U.ClaimScope

```

Adoption test: after using C.33, another practitioner can tell what selected structure is captured, what structure is expected but not captured, what is lost or hidden, what use is admissible, which non-admissible uses are blocked, and which practical claim, question, rule, or test comes next. Record a stable reference only when that next use must travel independently.

What C.33 buys in practice: the practitioner can use a partial carrier without pretending it is complete. The pattern turns "this diagram, ADR, graph, report, or observation is useful" into a reviewable statement about captured structure, missing structure, missing-structure return, and the next claim or test that needs that structure.

Ordinary working move: underline the carrier sentence, diagram, graph edge set, or observation being relied on; write what selected structure it captures; write what it leaves out; then name the use that remains admissible.

When the current question concerns architecture, record, lens, reading, decision, authorization, or publication admissibility beyond structure-capture adequacy, use the pattern that defines or tests that object and question. Use C.33 for the captured and missing structural content on which that use depends.

### C.33:2 - Problem

Architecture work depends on partial carriers. Diagrams, views, relation graphs, ADRs, model queries, code-agent probes, neural-network architecture reviews, eval reports, method descriptions, and operation observations can carry enough structure for one action while losing structure needed for another action.

The practical problem is not "is the carrier good?" The problem is: what selected structure can be recovered from it for this declared architecture use, and what missing-structure return is needed before relying on it further?

Common failures:

- a diagram, model, generated graph, ADR, or benchmark trace starts acting as architecture by presentation;
- structural information is confused with a score, entropy value, epiplexity estimate, dashboard reading, or eval result;
- hidden structure becomes invisible exactly when a later candidate, decision, or work method depends on it;
- source labels such as layer, router, expert, cache, memory, block, gate, SSM, pruning, distillation, or architecture search are copied as FPF ontology instead of being recovered through current FPF rules that define the relevant structures and relations;
- partial-observation outputs from code agents or AI tools are treated as internal belief proof, safe-change authority, evidence sufficiency, or release confidence.

### C.33:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Useful carriers vs overread | A small carrier can guide architecture work, but it cannot carry every selected structure, decision, evidence, or work claim. |
| Capture vs loss | Architecture use often depends as much on what was lost or hidden as on what was captured. |
| Cheap first note vs full record | Many cases need one note before a full architecture description, view correspondence record, measurement, or eval result. |
| Observer boundary | Code agents, learned representations, probes, and epiplexity-like lenses expose structure under observation and budget limits. |
| Source label pressure | Domain labels are useful recognition cues. Resolve an ambiguous label only when its meaning changes the selected structure, relation, bearer, characteristic, or next claim; use the rule or test for that claim. |
| Evolution | Captured structural information may no longer be adequate for the declared use when source publication edition, realized structure, environment, bearer, or holon level changes. |

### C.33:4 - Solution

Create one `StructuralInformationAdequacyNote@Context` for the declared architecture use.

Read the note as a small missing-structure return tool, not as a new documentation format. Its didactic question is simple: "What can I safely take from this carrier, what must I not take, and where do I go if the missing structure matters?"

Work in this order:

1. Name the architecture claim or pre-claim, described holon, architecture concern, intended use, and any ClaimScope or qualification window that changes the adequacy judgment.
2. Name the selected structure refs or structure kinds being relied on. If they are not recoverable, stop and use `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.22`, or `C.32.P2S`.
3. Name the carrier, selected source structure, description, view, narrative rendering, decision record, eval report, method handoff, generated relation graph, or realized observation being used.
4. State the captured selected structure in relation terms: relations, constraints, invariants, allocations, compositions, variation classes, operations, dynamics refs, or preserved organization.
5. State the expected but uncaptured structure when the next use needs it: hidden placement, data custody, runtime dependency, transformation-flow relation, unexplored region, or missing bearer. State any unresolved source-label semantics or missing confidence class separately when it changes that use.
6. State lost or hidden structure. If no loss is claimed, justify why the carrier is adequate for the declared use rather than for all uses.
7. Add observer or budget boundary when the carrier comes from a bounded observer, learned representation, probe, relation graph, or epiplexity-style lens.
8. Add source label recovery when unresolved terms from a domain practice such as neural-network architectures, software modules, built assets, organizational roles, methods, or work change an architecture claim or its next use.
9. Use the pattern that defines or tests each mathematical-lens, measurement, eval, decision, evidence, assurance, gate, release, method, work, or publication claim when one of those claims is current.
10. Stop when admissible use, non-admissible use, missing-structure return condition, the next claim or question, and its required rule or test are clear.

CGUS-aware neighbor use: when a carrier, route card, narrative rendering, architecture description, framework publication, or generated relation graph is relied on because it preserves a constraint-governed unfolding structure, C.33 records only what that carrier captures and loses. The selected structure remains `ConstraintGovernedUnfoldingStructure@Context` or a local `U.Structure` block governed by `A.22.CGUS`, `E.18.3`, `C.32.P2S`, `E.23`, or another direct structure pattern. When the carrier is a narrative, `A.6.3.NAR` governs only its selected-source carry-through, ordering and connective account, loss, reader use, and source return; it neither selects nor admits the structure.

A `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context` may be the `U.Episteme` slice or presentation whose captured structure and lost structure C.33 records; it is not the selected `U.Structure` by itself. C.33 does not admit the CGUS; it tells the practitioner handling the next question what the carrier actually preserved and where missing selected structure must be inspected or repaired.

### C.33:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Tell: C.33 is the pattern for using a partial carrier that captures or describes selected structure without letting that carrier stand for the whole architecture. The carrier may be a diagram, decision record, query result, eval report, code-agent map, neural-network architecture review, method handoff, or observation of the realized holon. The grounding question is not whether the carrier is impressive. The grounding question is what selected structure it captures, what it leaves out, and which practical claim or question must be addressed next under which concrete rule or test. Add exact C.2.1 identity only if that claim must travel independently.

Show - system case. An ADR-like record says "use event-carried integration with bounded exception." C.33 records that the carrier captures the selected integration style, exception boundary, and method expectation. It does not capture lower-level placement constraints, schema evolution burden, runtime data custody, or deployment topology. The admissible use is decision memory and method handoff; the non-admissible use is proof that the realized modules have the intended architecture. A missing-structure condition reopens the C.32.PAD decision, C.32.ADR projection, C.30.AD description, and, if actual structure diverges, the C.32 synthesis question.

Show - episteme case. A code-agent relation graph finds imports, call edges, inferred module roles, and candidate invariants. C.33 records relation observation class `observed | inferred | unknownRegionPresent`, typed relation semantics, confidence class, active-passive gap when present, unexplored regions, and lost runtime or deployment structure. The graph can inform `C.34` preservation checks or be assessed under `C.35` for its next architecture use; it does not by itself prove an internal-belief claim, qualify as release evidence, or establish full architecture adequacy.

Show - neural architecture case. A neural-network architecture review says a model changed attention, SSM block, router, cache placement, pruning mask, and distillation path. C.33 recovers the selected structures and changes being described: dataflow relation, path-selection relation, memory placement, cache placement, and block substitution. It separately names affected characteristics such as latency, compute, memory, and robustness. Source labels remain source labels until recovered through `C.30.STRAT`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `C.31`, `C.32`, `C.16`, or `C.32.ACE` as applicable.

Show - architecture narrative case. A team narrative says "we moved from candidate A to candidate B because data custody forced placement P and made latency trade-off T acceptable." C.33 records the structural content and decision context the narrative captures: the move from candidate A to candidate B, data-custody constraint, placement constraint, and trade-off. It separately states the missing-structure return condition. It also records lost or hidden structure such as rejected candidate details, quantitative evals, module interfaces, and realization evidence. The narrative can help decision memory or team orientation; it is not by itself an architecture description, decision authority, or evidence of realized structure.

The small working form is enough when it blocks a wrong next use. It is not enough when the next claim needs an architecture description, structural view, decision repair, eval program, evidence record, assurance case, gate, release, or work authorization. In those cases C.33 produces the missing-structure return condition and then exits.

### C.33:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | How C.33 counters it |
| --- | --- |
| Carrier completeness bias | Require captured selected structure, lost or hidden structure, admissible use, and non-admissible use before relying on the carrier; add expected but uncaptured structure when the next use depends on it. |
| Metric bias | Treat entropy, epiplexity estimate, benchmark score, dashboard value, dependency F1, and invariant F1 as readings only when `C.16` or `C.32.ACE` has opened that claim. |
| Source-label ontology bias | Keep source labels such as layer, router, cache, expert, pruning, distillation, block, DSM cluster, and architecture-search result as source wording. When a label carries an unresolved FPF structure or relation claim, use `C.30.STRAT`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `A.6.M`, `C.31`, `C.32`, or another direct subject pattern to recover the object and predicate for that claim. |
| Observer-belief bias | Record observation class, confidence, active-passive gap when present, budget boundary, and unexplored regions for agent-produced or probe-produced carriers. Do not infer internal belief, safe change, or assurance from a map. |
| Decision-memory bias | Treat ADR-like records as decision descriptions and method expectations. Use `C.32.PAD` or `C.32.ADR` for decision and projection claims, and use C.33 only for what structural content the record carries or loses. |

### C.33:7 - Conformance checklist

| Check | Pass condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-C33-1` | The note names the described holon, architecture concern and intended use, selected structure refs or structure kinds, carrier or observation being used, any evidence supporting an adequacy or insufficiency conclusion, and any material ClaimScope or qualification window. |
| `CC-C33-2` | Captured selected structure is stated as relations, constraints, invariants, allocations, compositions, variation classes, operations, dynamics refs, or preserved organization. |
| `CC-C33-3` | Expected but uncaptured structure and lost or hidden structure are stated when the next use depends on them. |
| `CC-C33-4` | Observer or budget boundary is present for agent-produced, learned, probed, or epiplexity-style carriers, and for maps derived from a named source publication, source model, or source codebase. |
| `CC-C33-5` | Each current mathematical-lens, measurement, eval, decision, evidence, assurance, gate, release, method, work, or publication claim uses the pattern that defines or tests it. |
| `CC-C33-6` | Admissible use, non-admissible use, missing-structure return condition, the next claim or question, and its required rule or test are named. |

### C.33:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagram as complete architecture | The diagram may show modules or links while hiding placement, runtime dependency, control authority, evidence structure, bearer constraints, or data custody. | Write the C.33 note from the diagram: captured structure, missing structure, lost relation semantics, admissible use, and the condition that reopens the next dependent claim or question. Add its exact predicate and assertion identity only when that identity must travel independently. |
| ADR as realized structure proof | A decision record can carry decision memory and method expectation without showing what was built or how it behaves. | Use `C.32.PAD` for the project decision claim and `C.32.ADR` for its record projection; use C.33 only for the structural content and loss carried by the record; state realization claims using the exact architecture or evidence predicate and cite the pattern that defines or tests it when that reference is needed. |
| Narrative as complete architecture | A narrative can preserve a route through selected structures while hiding placement, alternatives, measurements, interfaces, or realized structure. | Use `A.6.3.NAR` for the structure-to-narrative rendering relation and C.33 for captured and lost selected structure before architecture reuse. |
| Code-agent graph as safe-change authority | A graph can expose observed and inferred relations while leaving unknown regions and hidden invariants. | Add observation class, confidence, unexplored regions, and non-admissible use. Use the patterns that define the safe-change, assurance, gate, and release checks when those claims are current. |
| Metric as structural adequacy | A score, entropy value, epiplexity estimate, benchmark trace, or dependency F1 is a reading only under the applicable measurement or eval rule. | Use `C.16` to establish what is measured and how the reading may be used, `C.25` when a Q-bundle claim is current, and `C.32.ACE` for architecture evaluation. Keep any mathematical-lens claim with `C.29`. |
| Neural label import | Terms such as attention, SSM, router, expert, cache, pruning, distillation, and NAS can hide several structure kinds and characteristics. | Recover the selected structure kind, relation, bearer, affected characteristic, preserved structure, and lost structure needed by the architecture claim, and identify the next claim plus the rule or test it needs before relying on the label for that use. |

### C.33:9 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- A partial carrier becomes usable without becoming authoritative. The architect can take exactly the structure that is recoverable and stop before overreading the carrier.
- Missing-structure return becomes local and reviewable: the note says which missing structure requires C.30, C.30.ASV, C.32.P2S, C.32, PAD, ADR, C.29, C.16, ACE, evidence, assurance, or work checks before the next use.
- AI-produced maps and maps derived from named source publications, source models, or source codebases become safer architecture inputs because observation class, confidence, unexplored regions, and budget boundary are visible.
- Neural-network and code-architecture source labels become usable without importing those labels as FPF ontology.

Costs and trade-offs:

- C.33 adds one small note before some architecture work. The cost is justified only when a next use might overread a carrier.
- The note can be too weak for decision, evidence, assurance, eval, release, or realized-structure claims. In those cases C.33 should stop early and use the pattern that defines or tests the current claim.
- A team may discover that a familiar diagram or ADR is insufficient for the intended use. That is not a failure of C.33; it is the missing-structure return condition doing its job.

### C.33:10 - Rationale

Architecture work often starts from carriers that are neither useless nor complete. Both facts matter for the next architecture use. If C.33 only says "do not confuse the carrier with architecture," it becomes a negative catalogue. If it treats every carrier as an architecture description or measurement, it duplicates C.30, C.16, and C.32.ACE. The chosen solution is a small adequacy note whose center is captured selected structure, lost structure, admissible use, and missing-structure return.

This split keeps P2S as the whole architecturing spine and C.32 as the pattern that describes candidate synthesis. C.33 does not synthesize architecture and does not decide the project architecture. It gives the practitioner and the next check a typed account of what a carrier contributes and what must still be recovered.

The source choices explain the fields. Epiplexity motivates observer-bounded structural information but not a universal architecture metric. Multi-relational structural entropy motivates relation-kind awareness but not adequacy by number. Sapunov and ToCS motivate partial observability, active-passive gap, invariant fields, confidence, and unexplored regions. GonzoML motivates richer neural architecture operation language without making those labels FPF ontology.

### C.33:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source or practice line | Adopt, adapt, or reject | Concrete C.33 locus changed | Boundary and currentness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Finzi et al., `From Entropy to Epiplexity`, arXiv:2601.03220 | Adapt observer-bounded structural information. | Adds `observerOrBudgetBoundary?`, strengthens hidden-structure and compression guidance, and supports the warning that recoverable structure is observer-bound. | Epiplexity is not an architecture characteristic, proof, selector, evidence, assurance, decision, or realized-structure observation by itself. Reopen the note when observer budget, source publication edition, or downstream use changes. |
| Cao et al., `Multi-Relational Structural Entropy`, arXiv:2405.07096 | Adapt relation heterogeneity and graph structural-information pressure. | Strengthens `typedRelationSemantics?`, relation-kind recovery, and measurement or eval routing. | For a graph entropy value, use `C.16` when measurement is claimed and `C.32.ACE` when architecture evaluation is current; it does not establish architecture adequacy. |
| Sapunov, `Theory of Code Space`, and ToCS code-agent architecture-map practice | Adopt the partial-observability and belief-probing lessons; adapt them beyond software code agents. | Adds `relationObservationClass?`, confidence class, active-passive gap, unexplored regions, invariant return to the named architecture source map or the rule that defines the invariant claim, and non-overread of JSON probes and benchmark scores. | A probe, JSON output, dependency F1, invariant F1, active-passive gap, or benchmark score is not architecture adequacy, evidence sufficiency, safe-change authority, assurance, gate passage, or release authority. Reopen when the probed codebase, architecture source map, or observation budget changes. |
| GonzoML neural-network architecture intake | Adapt practitioner operation labels into FPF recovery steps. | Adds neural source-label recovery for block substitution, dataflow change, routing, gating, cache, memory, pruning, distillation, NAS, ablation, and affected characteristics. | Source labels and results do not become FPF ontology or adequacy. Recover the selected structure, relation, bearer, affected characteristic, and loss needed by the architecture claim, and identify the next claim plus its required rule before relying on the label for that use. |

C.33 rejects the shortcut: "the richest available diagram, map, score, or model summary is the architecture content." The better practice is to ask what the carrier captures for one declared use and what it cannot support. Use each SoTA contribution only for the fields, stop conditions, or concrete next-use rules named in its row.

### C.33:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.22`, `C.30`, `C.30.AD`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.32.P2S`, and `C.32`.
- **Uses:** `C.29` when a mathematical lens exposes or compresses structure; `C.16`, `C.25`, and `C.32.ACE` when a claim about captured or lost structure is recorded as a measurement, Q-bundle slot, criterion, or eval reading.
- **Coordinates with:** `C.30.STRAT`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `A.6.M`, `A.6.3.NAR`, `C.31`, `C.31.ASAP`, `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.ADR`, `G.5`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `E.18`, `F.9`, and `F.15`.
- **Boundary:** C.33 governs structure-capture adequacy and missing-structure return for a declared architecture use. It does not ground architecture, select candidates, decide projects, publish records, measure values, supply evidence or assurance, authorize work, or claim realization.
