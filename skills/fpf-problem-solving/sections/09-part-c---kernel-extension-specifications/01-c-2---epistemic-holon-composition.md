## C.2 - Epistemic holon composition (KD-CAL)

**Scope & exports.** A substrate-neutral calculus for composing **epistemic holons** (`U.Episteme`) and reasoning about their change and equivalence. Exports: (i) three **point-characteristics**—**Formality F**, **ClaimScope G**, **Reliability R**—that locate one exact claim-bearing episteme for a stated use; (ii) a **pairwise ladder** of **Congruence Levels (CL 0…3)**; (iii) four **Δ-moves** (*Formalise, Generalise/Specialise, Calibrate/Validate, Congrue*); (iv) **composition rules** (Γ_epist) for aggregates; and (v) propagation laws for CL through mappings and notation relations. C.2.1 identifies an episteme by its exact claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` under `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`. Empirical grounding and edition are separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance use E.17.0; mathematical or diagrammatic representation uses C.29 and A.6.3.RT; publication uses E.17/E.24.PUB; a carrier remains a distinct entity. Every F–G–R computation names the exact claim and its `U.ClaimScope`. If a path changes scope, notation, kind, reference plane, source-local meaning, model-use basis, or evidence basis, it names the actual relation traversed and applies only the loss that relation declares; no generic Context, slot umbrella, or Bridge stands in for those different relations.

**Formality F** is the rigor characteristic defined **normatively in C.2.3**. All KD‑CAL computations and guards **SHALL** use `U.Formality` (F0…F9) as specified there; **no parallel “mode” ladders** are allowed.

### C.2:1 - Problem Frame

FPF fixes two archetypal sub-holons: **`U.System`** (physical/operational) and **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge holon). KD-CAL is the primary composition pattern for `U.Episteme`, giving engineers a compact, testable way to say (a) how strictly an episteme is written (**F**), (b) where its exact claim is asserted to apply (**G**), (c) how well that claim is warranted by evidence or severe tests (**R**), and (d) how closely **two** epistemes coincide (**CL**). C.2.1 supplies the constitution test: exact claim content, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Grounding, edition, viewpoint, view, representation, publication, form, and carrier remain neighboring objects or relations under their direct patterns.

### C.2:2 - Problem

Teams routinely entangle **programs, specifications, proofs, and datasets**; a proof is treated as evidence that an actual system meets its assumptions, or a program as if it entailed a theorem. Warrant becomes opaque when support and its applicable currentness conditions are not explicit. Epistemes are anthropomorphised as actors (“the standard enforces…”), producing category errors at execution. Aggregation can hide a missing necessary premise, erase complementary support, or conceal contrary evidence behind an unjustified score. KD-CAL keeps constitution, input meanings, scales, and support dependencies explicit.

### C.2:3 - Forces

* **Universality vs domain idioms.** One calculus must cover physics theories, legal codes, safety specs, algorithms, and formal proofs without flattening their differences.
* **Meaning vs materiality.** Meaning must be independent of carrier, yet accountable to it historically.
* **Deductive vs empirical.** Axiomatic certainty and empirical trust have different evidence-continuity profiles; both must compose.
* **Abstraction vs enactment.** Epistemes constrain action; **systems** act. The calculus must keep the roles distinct.

### C.2:4 - Solution

#### C.2:4.1 - Coordinates, constitution, and neighboring relations

**KD‑CAL characteristics (single‑episteme, point‑values).**

* **Formality F.** From free prose to **machine‑checkable proof/specification**. Litmus: *would a machine reject it if wrong?*
* **Claim scope (G), a set‑valued applicability over `U.ContextSlice`, with ∩/SpanUnion/translate algebra; CL penalties apply to R, not to F/G.** Litmus: *how wide is the declared scope, and under what minimal assumptions does the claim hold?*
* **Reliability R.** Warrant for this exact claim and receiving use. Litmus: *what supports this conclusion, under which assumptions, and what limits it?* **R-claims MUST bind to their actual formal or empirical support.** A numerical R requires the B.3/C.2.2 meaning, scale, and model; otherwise retain separate support and a bounded reasoned conclusion. A proof under axioms needs no empirical score, and F cannot be substituted for R. Relevance windows and B.3.4 currentness rules apply where the relied-on support consumes them.

 **Congruence Level (CL), pairwise ladder.**
 `CL‑0` **Opposed/Disjoint** (contrastive; no substitution); `CL‑1` **Comparable / Naming‑only** (label similarity; no substitution); `CL‑2` **Translatable / RoleAssignment‑eligible** (structure‑preserving mapping in a declared fragment with **stated loss**; theorems may transport); `CL‑3` **Near‑identity / Type‑structure‑safe** (invariants match; type‑structure substitution allowed). *CL is a characteristic of a relation between two epistemes; it is not a fourth member of the F–G–R assurance tuple and it is not a characteristic space of its own.* **Norm:** substitution is permitted only if plane‑preserving and **CL ≥ 2**; substituting **type‑structure** requires **CL = 3**.

**Constitution and neighboring relations.** State F, G, and R for one exact claim of one C.2.1 episteme. Its exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` identify the episteme through `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`. F characterizes the claim's form; G is the separate `U.ClaimScope`; R relies on exact evaluation, evidence-use, and assurance relations. Empirical grounding and edition remain separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and view conformance remain under E.17.0; notation and other representation structure remain under C.29/A.6.3.RT; publication occurrence, form, and carrier remain under E.17/E.24.PUB. Multiple notations are allowed only when their exact representation or notation relation is explicit and any declared loss is applied to R rather than hidden in an omnibus episteme field.

#### C.2:4.2 - Four Δ‑moves (epistemic motion)

* **ΔF — Formalise.** Rewrite for stricter calculi/grammars; raise proof obligations.
* **ΔG — Generalise / Specialise.** Widen or narrow the **claim scope** (assumptions & scope). Changes to decomposition granularity are an **orthogonal view** and do not change **G** unless they alter the envelope.
* **ΔR — Calibrate / Validate.** Revise warrant through support that actually bears on the claim: proof or reasoning, calibration, severe tests, or monitoring as applicable. State what the contribution changes. A formalization alone is ΔF, not an R increase; choosing new inquiry is a separate decision.
* **ΔCL — Congrue.** Establish and record the sameness relation between **two** epistemes (ladder 0→3).
  Moves compose into **paths**. A CL chain minimum retains only the ordered congruence meaning justified by the relation family; it is not a numerical reliability loss.

#### C.2:4.3 - Composition (Γ_epist) and propagation

Let **Γ_epist** compose exact epistemes `{Eᵢ}` for one declared claim and use. B.1.3 supplies the synthesis/compilation Method; B.3 and C.2.2 govern warrant and scale discipline.

* **R (Reliability).** First distinguish indispensable premises, alternative sufficient arguments, complementary evidence, different scope slices, and counterevidence. Identify duplicated data and shared assumptions or bias. A numerical fold requires warranted input meanings, compatible scales, dependencies, and a receiving model. Neither series nor parallel syntax supplies a default minimum or maximum, and there is no universal cap at the best support line. Where no common model is justified, retain separate contributions and limitations in a bounded reasoned synthesis.
* **F (Formality).** `F(Γ) = minᵢ F(Eᵢ)` over the essential formal constituents of the claim. This is an ordinal formality statement, not an R calculation. Raise F by the actual ΔF move; neither an axiomatic mode nor a `line=formal` tag converts F into empirical warrant.
* **G (ClaimScope).** Required premises compose only on their overlapping scope. Distinct supported slices may form `SpanUnion({G_path})` under A.2.6 and C.2.2's type-before-scope rule; retain their support separately and drop unsupported regions. A new source does not by itself generalise the claim. Scope change remains an explicit ΔG± move.
* **CL (Congruence).** Keep each traversed mapping and the ordered meaning of its declared CL visible. A chain minimum is usable where that relation's congruence rule justifies it. A notation, scope-translation, kind, plane, source-local, model-use, or evidence-reuse relation contributes only its own warranted loss. A numerical Φ needs its receiving model; a monotone table or clipped output does not supply one.

For example, two necessary independent conditions with probabilities 0.9 each have conjunction probability 0.81, not minimum 0.9. Conversely, a limited complementary source need not reduce the support already available. A credible contrary result changes the affected conclusion. A theorem A ⇒ P remains valid as a formal result while evidence violating A can defeat its use as assurance of an actual system.

Γ remains defined on holons and respects the core's identity and boundary discipline. Its support account establishes neither a new action permission nor the worth of acquiring further evidence.

#### C.2:4.4 - What **must not** be conflated (normative guards)

* **Representation structure ≠ carrier.** Files, PDFs, or repositories are **carriers** outside the episteme; they never count as parts of `U.Episteme` (**see C.2.1 EP‑1; CC‑EPI‑2/3**).
* **Epistemes do not act.** Only **systems** perform Work. Epistemes carry claim content and can participate in constitution, grounding, edition, description, evidence-use, reliance, viewing, representation, and publication relations under their direct patterns.
* **CL is not a score.** It is a **qualitative ladder** of preservation classes; do not average it.

### C.2:5 - ✱ Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Universal rule (tell).** *Compose knowledge by Γ_epist with explicit support roles, dependence, scope, and justified input scales. Use the receiving model for any R calculation, or return a bounded non-aggregate synthesis. Identify the episteme by exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme; keep empirical grounding, edition, viewpoint selection, view conformance, representation, publication form, publication occurrence, and carrier in their own direct relations.*

**System (show, current physical-system lens).** Consider a **battery-pack thermal subsystem** integrating a physics model of heat flow and an operating envelope for fast-charge. As a **system**, it composes pumps, sensors, and controllers through the system, composition, boundary, state, and dynamics guidance in `A.1`, `A.14`, `A.22`, and `A.3.4`, with conservation constraints made explicit; `B.1.6` and `C.16` govern resource and measurement claims as applicable. Planned `C.1` (Sys-CAL) may later consolidate that guidance, but it supplies no current governing semantics. The assurance story depends on epistemes about the model and envelope; the system **acts**, epistemes constrain. (Archetypes and boundary discipline per core.)

**Episteme (show, KD-CAL lens).** Consider a **CMIP-class climate projection episteme** (post-2015 generation): its exact claim content covers PDEs and parameterisations; its EntityOfConcern identifies what the projection claims concern; and its effective reference scheme supplies the interpretation rules. A separate `U.ClaimScope` names historical forcings, resolution, and assumptions. Any empirical-grounding occurrence names the grounding holon and covered claim subgraph separately. Its representation may include domain equations and a tabular schema linked by an explicit notation or representation relation with stated loss. When composing radiation, cloud, and ocean-mixing contributions, identify which assumptions the particular projection requires and what each hindcast actually tests. Shared models or data do not establish independent confirmation. An aggregate R needs the domain quantity and dependency model; otherwise retain the separate tests, assumptions, scope limits, and any disagreements. F remains an ordinal account of the essential formal constituents.

### C.2:6 - Bias‑Annotation

* **Metric worship.** Treating `[F,G,R]` as ends rather than means; mitigation: require **evidence bindings** and narrative of limits in the claim scope and grounding envelope.
* **Category slip.** Equating a notation, view, publication form, or carrier with claim content, EntityOfConcern, effective reference scheme, or an empirical-grounding participant; mitigation: apply C.2.1 constitution and then the direct neighboring relation pattern.
* **Analogy inflation.** Presenting CL‑0/1 as identity; mitigation: always name the **CL rung** for cross‑mappings.

### C.2:7 - Conformance Checklist

1. **C2-1 (Episteme constitution and neighbors).** Every `U.Episteme` **MUST** satisfy C.2.1 constitution through exact claim content, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Empirical grounding and edition are stated through their separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance use E.17.0; representation uses C.29/A.6.3.RT; publication occurrence, form, and carrier use E.17/E.24.PUB. None is treated as an episteme slot or identity component merely because a record or notation places it beside the constitution values.
2. **C2‑2 (Coordinates).** Each episteme **SHALL** declare `[F,G,R]` for its exact claim and use with a brief rationale; where R has no justified numerical model, retain its unquantified support and bounded conclusion. Formal validity needs no empirical score; **F** is `U.Formality ∈ {F0…F9}` per **C.2.3**, **exactly one episteme‑level F** computed as the **min over essential parts**. CL is declared for **pairs only**. A named notation scheme **MAY** use sub‑anchors (e.g., `F4[OCL]`, `F7[HOL]`), which **MUST** preserve the global order and **map to their parent anchor** from C.2.3.
3. **C2‑3 (Composition).** Authors **SHALL** identify support roles and dependencies under B.1.3/C.2.2 before combining inputs. Any numerical R or loss **MUST** have justified meanings, scales, assumptions, and a receiving model under B.3; no universal min/max or F-to-R conversion applies. Otherwise return separate support and a bounded synthesis. F uses the minimum over essential formal constituents; G uses applicable path intersections and supported SpanUnion under A.2.6. Every reuse **MUST** name the actual direct relation and retain its warranted limitation; do not hide contrary evidence or unsupported scope.
4. **C2‑4 (NotationBridge).** Multi‑notation representation components **SHOULD** register `NotationBridge` edges with CL and loss note; any cross‑notation reasoning **MUST** cite the bridge’s CL.
5. **C2‑5 (No action).** Epistemes **MUST NOT** be assigned actions; work is executed by systems in role.

### C.2:8 - Consequences

**Benefits.** A compact map for knowledge epistemes; visible support dependencies and limitations; useful formal and qualitative results alongside justified calculations; disciplined reuse across domains with explicit CL; consistent separation of meaning from material carriers.
**Trade-offs.** Authors must identify the support relation and any calculation model; multi-notation work keeps its relation-specific basis. Some useful syntheses have no common scalar. *Mitigation:* the C.2.1 constitution test and direct neighboring patterns keep the ordinary entry brief while preserving recoverable precision.

### C.2:9 - Rationale

KD-CAL turns the coarse legacy semiotic picture into **holonic composition** over exact C.2.1 epistemes and their claims. Exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme keep episteme identity stable; formal structure and claim scope (**F,G**), evidence (**R**), and pairwise congruence (**CL**) remain visible and composable without an omnibus slot relation. Direct grounding, edition, view, representation, publication, and carrier patterns prevent category collapse. The resulting characteristics remain **manager-readable** and **formalisation-ready**, with **G** grounded in scope/envelope rather than part count.

### C.2:10 - Relations

* **Depends on:** `C.2.1 U.Episteme: Constitution, Empirical Grounding, and Edition Relations` for episteme identity, the constitution relation, and the separate grounding and edition relations; `E.17.0` for viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance; `C.29` and `A.6.3.RT` for representation; and `E.17`/`E.24.PUB` for publication occurrence, form, and carrier.
* **Peers:** planned **Sys-CAL** (`C.1`) may later consolidate physical-system guidance; current system composition, boundary, state, conservation, resource, and measurement claims use `A.1`, `A.14`, `A.22`, `A.3.4`, `B.1.6`, and `C.16` as applicable. KD-CAL composes **epistemes** and feeds assurance lenses in Part B.
* **Constrained by authoring:** Architectural patterns must include Tell–Show–Show with **Archetypal Grounding** (this section).

### C.2:11 - Worked mini‑examples (post‑2015 flavours)

* **Formal lift (ΔF).** Recasting a 2019 **variational free‑energy** narrative into a typed calculus raises **F**, clarifies scope, and enables CL‑2 bridges between biological and ML formulations—*without* claiming empirical gain (**R** unchanged).
* **Complementary hindcast evidence.** Two hindcast lines supporting a climate projection may address different errors, reuse data, or cover different conditions. Identify those relations before combining them; a maximum may select one attested argument only under that declared meaning, not measure their combined corroboration. Keep disagreement and unsupported scope visible. This illustration supplies no climate-specific reliability model.
* **Notation bridge (CL drop).** A 2021 **type‑theoretic specification** rendered in a semi‑formal DSL requires a `NotationBridge` with a CL<3 note; any theorem transported across must respect the bridge’s declared preservation.

*(No tooling is implied; these are conceptual moves within the calculus.)*
