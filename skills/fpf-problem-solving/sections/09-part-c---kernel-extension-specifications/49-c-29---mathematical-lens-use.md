## C.29 - Mathematical Lens Use

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

**Plain-name.** Mathematical lens use.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** C.29 concerns a declared mathematical-lens use for a stated phenomenon, EntityOfConcern, relation, claim, or structure-bearing situation. The use names the mathematical object, formalism, learned representation, simulation object, local formal position, or mathematical family; the mapping mode; the preserved structure; the lost structure; the visible payoff or obstruction; the declared lens use; any justified blocked overread; and the stop or return condition. Such a use can be stated or cited in FPF-governed wording, pattern examples, method notes, review records, `PublicationUnit`s, decision-facing text, comparison-facing text, bridge-facing text, and assurance-input text. Include a blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test.

**Object designation, declaration, and representation discipline.** `CandidateMathObject` is the C.29-local field or designation for the mathematical object selected in one declared mathematical-lens-use claim or note; that object retains its direct kind. The field identifies the selected object for the mathematical representation, explicit correspondence, and preserved/lost-structure account; it does not assert a world-side participant meaning, participation, or use relation. `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` in `A.6.0` is a separate formal-declaration episteme use: it declares vocabulary, laws, imports, and applicability and is neither the `CandidateMathObject` designation nor a position in the selected representation. A direct use relation may be asserted only after a separate direct relation settlement supplies its participant meanings, obtaining predicate, applicability, and identity rule. `A.6.1` governs mechanism import or realization when that exact declaration is used in a mechanism; `E.18.1` governs P2W carry-through when accepted problem-side material needs the declaration for later work. The same mathematical object may be designated in several epistemes or uses, but the subject pattern is selected by the exact governed object and claim, not by a source-local head word.

**Relation-ontology boundary.** A formula, query, path, graph, diagram, name, assertion, or definition can represent or state a claim or derivation; it does not make a relation obtain, admit a relation kind, or supply occurrence identity. Resolve those questions first through `A.6.P`, `A.6.RCD`, and the direct subject settlement. Use C.29 only for the selected representation, its explicit correspondence, and the preserved and lost structure.

**Output boundary.** C.29 outputs are lens-use notes, one-line entries, mini-cards, full cards, and neighboring-pattern notes. For claim-bearing mathematical-lens use, they state which declared mathematical-lens use is bounded as usable, when to stop or return, and which neighboring FPF pattern defines or constrains any non-lens claim being made. Project approval, work, evidence, assurance, decision, or release use must be recorded through the subject pattern for that use.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when a mathematical object, formalism, simulation object, learned representation, or mathematical family is being used to make a project claim more inspectable, or when the lack of such a lens hides preserved structure, lost structure, invariants, obstruction, approximation, or stop condition.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Mathematical prestige starts acting as evidence, mechanism, architecture, causal proof, assurance, benchmark result, or release confidence; or a useful lens is avoided because no one states what it preserves and what it loses.

**What this buys.** The practitioner can use mathematics as a bounded lens: name the object, mapping, preserved and lost structure, visible payoff, declared use, neighboring subject pattern, and the condition for stopping or returning to the source.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current claim is evidence, assurance, causal use, measurement construction, architecture adequacy, work, gate passage, decision, formal signature, mechanism import, or publication use, use the subject pattern and keep C.29 only to the mathematical-lens use portion.

**No new `U.*` from C.29 local lens-use outputs.** `MathLensUse.OneLine`, `MathLensUse.MiniCard`, `MathLensUse.FullCard`, `MathLensUse.Card@Context`, `MathLensUseOutputRef`, and `CC-C29-*` are C.29-local instruments. They do not mint `U.MathLens`, `U.MathLensUseRecord`, `LensKind`, `MathLensUseCompliance`, or a durable record family. Durable names, kinds, or records require an accepted FPF naming and kind decision through `F.18`, `C.3`, `F.8`, and `E.9`.

### C.29:0 - First-use card

Use this card before the full card. It is enough for the first use pass unless publication, bridge, assurance input, benchmark, model selection, prediction, formal pattern claim, or repeated cross-case use is being made.

| First question | Required answer before claim-bearing lens use |
|---|---|
| Is the mathematical phrase changing the next lens-use action, or only helping recognition? | If no action changes, keep ordinary prose or write `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`. |
| What phenomenon is being seen through the lens? | Name `TargetPhenomenon` in problem-owning language. |
| What concrete mathematical object, formal position, learned representation, simulation object, or local formalism is being used? | Name `CandidateMathObject`; broad family names are prompts only. |
| What structure is preserved? | Name `PreservedStructure`. |
| What structure is lost or deliberately ignored? | Name `LostStructure`; empty loss needs equivalence or isomorphism justification. |
| When should this lens use narrow, stop, or return to another source or pattern? | Name `StopCondition`; a declared lens use requires that concrete condition. |

Start with the useful lens decision: choose, apply, bound, replace, or remove a mathematical lens when the mathematical structure changes explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance input, reusable transfer, or the next lens-use repair. If no next lens-use action changes, keep ordinary prose or write `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`. If state, transition, measurement, causal use, bridge semantics, temporal adequacy, assurance, selector, benchmark, or release is the claim being made, apply the governing FPF pattern and keep C.29 to the mathematical-lens use part.

### C.29:1 - Problem frame

FPF already uses mathematical structures in several local patterns. `A.6.P` asks for stable relation-precision structure during relation precision restoration; `A.3.3` governs dynamics; `A.19` governs characteristic spaces and structural overlays; `C.18.1` and `C.19.1` govern scale-law and Bitter-Lesson claims; `C.26` contains the separation of a quantum-like lens from physical quantum ontology; `F.9` governs cross-context bridges and loss.

The positive need is as important as the guard. In working projects, first-principles mathematical thinking starts from the smallest declared structure that can make a next lens-use action derivable, inspectable, or honestly blocked. A queue can expose waiting and bottlenecks, a state space can expose variables and transitions, a graph can expose dependencies, a metric-space distance or topology can expose comparability limits, a symmetry can expose invariants, a variational principle or constrained optimization functional can expose an extremal condition, constrained variation space, boundary condition, conservation link, or trade-off, an information or probability measure can expose uncertainty, a resource bound can expose realizability limits, and an obstruction can expose where a transfer or simplification stops.

The missing FPF rule is general but narrow: when FPF-governed wording, a pattern example, method note, review record, `PublicationUnit`, or neighboring-pattern note uses or plausibly needs a mathematical object, formalism, or family for explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance input, or reusable application, the `C.29` application records the useful first-principles modeling structure and its boundary. It names the candidate mathematical object or family, what structure is preserved, what structure is lost, what invariant, lens-bounded distinction, obstruction, diagnostic boundary, or constructive limit becomes visible, which `LensUseBoundaryValue` value is declared for that use, and where the mathematical-lens use stops.

A C.29 application is justified when a mathematical object is used for explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance input, or reusable transfer, or when a stable working problem is under-lensed and a cheap candidate lens could expose useful structure for the next lens-use action. Mathematical appearance alone is not enough.

The first lens-use action is not a full-card demand. It is a first-principles entry decision: choose the smallest mathematical structure that changes the next lens-use action, keep ordinary prose when no mathematical structure changes the action, or apply the governing FPF pattern when the claim being made is outside the declared lens use. The result records what the lens preserves, what it loses, what it makes visible, what remains blocked, and where the use stops.

Selected compact formulation:

> **A useful mathematical lens is compression with invariants and declared losses.**

This compact line is retained as a Plain-register orientation, not as a substitute for the card. It keeps the useful metaphor of a **lens**: a mathematical object can make a hidden structure visible, but only by carrying some structure and dropping other structure. The first practitioner questions are: **what survives the transfer, what is lost, what can now be done, and where does the lens stop?**

#### C.29:1.1 - First-minute working situation

A practitioner applying FPF faces a working situation where ordinary prose can hide useful structure, or where a mathematical phrase is already doing work:

- waiting, backlog, bottleneck, or throughput can call for a queue or flow lens;
- state change, stabilization, control pressure, or forecast can call for state-space or dynamics vocabulary;
- dependency, interface, composition, or transfer failure can call for graph, hypergraph, category, operad, or compositional vocabulary;
- similarity, distribution shift, population movement, or shape change can call for metric-space distance, topology, embedding, or optimal-transport vocabulary;
- scale transition, coarse behavior, universality, knee, or scaling pressure can call for coarse-graining, RG, or scaling-law vocabulary;
- probe effects, order effects, context effects, or incompatible frames can call for quantum-like or contextual-probability vocabulary.

The useful first-minute intuition is “find the structure that would improve the next lens-use action, then name the limits.” A vivid phrase can remain when the `C.29` output records what the lens makes visible, what it does not license, and the exact subject assertion plus subject-pattern locator for any causal, evidence, bridge, dynamics, scale, measurement, assurance, or release claim.

Without a general lens-use discipline, the reader cannot tell whether the phrase is a bounded structure-preserving representation, an analogy-only prompt, an ungrounded ontology import, a local domain model, or prestige language.

#### C.29:1.2 - Minimum scenario and anti-case set

**Positive scenario.** A production line is represented as a queueing network. The lens preserves flow, bottlenecks, service rates, and waiting times; it loses human meaning, contractual obligations, rare failure modes, and causal interventions not represented by the network. Stop or change the lens when its assumptions fail or the use depends on one of those losses.

**Anti-case.** “The organization is a quantum system” is written without a candidate mathematical object, probe distinction or readout distinction, preserved structure, lost structure, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, or stop condition. The `C.29` result is either a downgrade to local metaphor or a repaired use through `C.29` and, where relevant, `C.26`.

**Under-lensed anti-case.** “The work stream has dynamics” or “this portfolio is a network” is used for a diagnosis that affects prediction, comparison, repair, or stop conditions, but no mathematical object changes what can be predicted, compared, diagnosed, repaired, or stopped. The repair is to choose a cheap candidate lens that exposes useful structure, or keep the sentence as ordinary prose.

**False-positive scenario.** A Markov kernel appears inside accepted local reliability modeling. If no contested lens-transfer, publication, assurance, bridge, or reusable explanation claim is being made, the claim stays under `A.3.3` and does not require a C.29 output.

#### C.29:1.3 - Intended FPF use-value

`C.29` gives a cheap-output choice before any full card or boundary table. Its first job is to help the working reader introduce, choose, repair, bound, or decline a mathematical lens by selecting the cheapest honest output: no C.29 output, a candidate note, a one-line repair, a mini-card, a full card when high-reliance use requires it, or a neighboring-pattern note when the claim being made is outside declared mathematical-lens use. Use it only when the mathematical lens affects a claim or next lens-use action; ordinary local math and decorative prose stay outside C.29. A successful `C.29` result makes useful mathematical compression available to FPF as a disciplined modeling action while reducing ontology smuggling, prestige vocabulary, loss-free transfer, causal laundering, bridge duplication, evidence laundering, and assurance laundering.

### C.29:2 - Problem

Accepted FPF mathematical-lens use criteria are distributed and local:

- `A.6.P` governs relation precision restoration, but not every mathematical-object transfer.
- `A.3.3` governs state, transition, observation, validity, constraints, and calibration for dynamics, but not all mathematical representation choices.
- `A.19` governs characteristic spaces, structural overlays, comparability, normalization, and bridge-aware state comparison, but not the adequacy of all mathematical lenses.
- `C.18.1` and `C.19.1` govern scale-law and BLP claims, but not non-scale mathematical lenses.
- `C.26` is the local precedent for mathematical-lens detachment, but only for quantum-like modeling.
- `F.9` governs cross-context semantic bridges, but does not decide whether a mathematical object, formalism, or learned representation is adequate inside one context or as a domain-transferring lens.

There are two symmetric failure modes.

The first failure mode is mathematical under-lensing: a working situation needs a mathematical lens that changes prediction, comparison, diagnosis, repair, or stop conditions, but the record contains only ordinary prose, familiar school math, or a broad family name such as graph, field, space, score, trend, dynamics, or quantum-like without a useful invariant, obstruction, state variable, mapping, scale behavior, rival lens, or action-changing payoff.

The second failure mode is mathematical overread:

> a mathematical phrase begins as a helpful representation and then silently becomes ontology, evidence, causality, comparability, assurance, or use-boundary claim.

### C.29:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Compression vs truthfulness** | A useful mathematical lens compresses many cases by pairing compression with declared losses. |
| **Plural mathematical foundations vs FPF simplicity** | The intended gain is access to modern plural foundations and applied mathematics, with each selected lens tied to a stated use, declared loss, and neighboring-pattern application. |
| **SoTA openness vs metaphysical safety** | Vanchurin-like and Sandberg-like material enters as current lens prompts, not final ontology. |
| **General pattern vs local precision** | `C.29` stays non-duplicative with `A.6.P`, `F.9`, `C.26`, `C.28`, `A.3.3`, and `A.19`; its contribution is coordination around declared mathematical-lens use. |
| **Didactic usability vs formal rigor** | The first user needs one small card; expert use needs lens mapping mode, invariant claims, loss, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, rival lenses, and stop conditions. |
| **Evocative metaphor vs ontology guard** | “Lens,” “structure survives transfer,” and “where the lens stops” help readers think, while fields named by value recover FPF claim-bearing use or use-boundary claim. |
| **Transfer reach vs domain fit** | Category, RG, variational, quantum-like, and learning lenses are useful because they transfer across domains; that same transfer reach makes misuse easy. |

### C.29:4 - Solution - selected answer

#### C.29:4.1 - Selected answer in one paragraph

`C.29 — Mathematical Lens Use` is the general FPF discipline for mathematical lenses used in explanation, decision, prediction, publication, comparison, assurance input, bridge, or reusable transfer. It handles two first-use cases, with the positive case first: an under-lensed situation where the next lens-use action can benefit from a cheap first candidate lens; and an existing candidate lens proposed for application, repair, bounding, replacement, or rejection. Its job is to help the reader introduce, choose, apply, limit, replace, or remove a mathematical lens so that a useful next lens-use action survives. A mathematical lens is usable for a declared use when it compresses a phenomenon by preserving declared structure, exposing useful invariants, and producing lens-bounded predictions, distinctions, obstructions, or diagnostic boundaries inside a bounded context. It is blocked for an undeclared or out-of-bound use when it imports source-domain ontology, hides loss under metaphor, treats source prestige as evidence, or licenses claims outside its declared scale, context, validation, bridge, causal, or assurance boundary.

`C.29` does not mint `MathLens`, `U.MathLens`, `LensKind`, or any universal FPF lens object. In this pattern, “mathematical lens” names a declared use of a mathematical object, formalism, learned representation, simulation object, or mathematical family under declared mapping, preserved structure and lost structure, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, declared lens use, and stop condition; the target phenomenon and any claim outside that declared lens use keep their own FPF kinds.

Naming boundary: C.29 governs mathematical-lens use claims. It does not mint mathematical-lens kinds, and it does not govern or create the EntityOfConcern named by a neighboring claim-bearing episteme, Bridge, evidence relation, causal-use relation, assurance score, measurement construction, dynamics semantics, decision record, work record, explanation rendering, comparative review unit, representation transition, coarsened rendering, selector, benchmark, or scale audit. Its outputs are local lens-use outputs unless another accepted FPF pattern names a durable FPF kind.

#### C.29:4.2 - Mathematical Lens Use Principle

> **Mathematical Lens Use Principle.**
> A mathematical lens is usable for a declared use when it compresses a phenomenon by preserving declared structure, exposing useful invariants, and producing lens-bounded predictions, distinctions, obstructions, or diagnostic boundaries inside a bounded context. It is blocked for an undeclared or out-of-bound use when it imports source-domain ontology, hides loss under metaphor, treats source prestige as evidence, or licenses claims outside its declared scale, context, validation, bridge, causal, or assurance boundary.

Compact plain form:

> **A useful mathematical lens is compression with invariants and declared losses.**

Register policy: **Tech exactness below, Plain metaphor above.** Plain phrases such as “structures that survive transfer,” “what the lens makes visible,” and “where the lens stops” are acceptable as recognition aids. When a sentence makes an FPF-kind, relation, evidence, use-boundary claim, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or pattern-application commitment, the corresponding `C.29` output recovers the fields named by value and subject patterns.

Zero and first-principles compatibility note: `E.1` and `E.2` govern the mission and pillar authority. `C.29` serves them by making mathematical first-principles lens use inspectable for one declared use: candidate mathematical object, preserved structure, lost structure, visible payoff, bounded lens-use action, neighboring-pattern boundary, and stop condition. It does not replace pillar authority, neighboring subject patterns, ordinary FPF reasoning, or the `E.9` design-rationale record for normative changes.

Mathematics is not a prerequisite for FPF use. Ordinary prose is enough when no mathematical structure changes the next lens-use action. C.29 earns its place only when a mathematical object, formalism, learned representation, simulation object, or mathematical family changes explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance input, reusable transfer, or the next lens-use repair.

Plain and Tech bridge:

| Plain reader question | Tech recovery |
|---|---|
| What structure helps? | `CandidateMathObject` or `CandidateLensFamily` in a `LensCandidateNote`. |
| How does it represent the phenomenon? | `LensMappingMode`. |
| What survives? | `PreservedStructure`. |
| What disappears or is deliberately ignored? | `LostStructure`. |
| Why trust this use? | `LensUseBoundaryValue`, validation overlay when validation use is being claimed, and governing evidence and assurance patterns when their claims are being made. |
| What can the reader now do? | `NextLensUseAction` or `declaredLensUse`. |
| When must this use stop or return? | `StopCondition`; include `blockedLensOverread?` only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. |

State and transition semantics stay with `A.3.3`; temporal aspects stay with `C.27.TA`; characteristic spaces and overlays stay with `A.19`; temporal-use adequacy stays with `C.27`; scale-law and general method-scale preference claims stay with `C.18.1` and `C.19.1`; architecture scale-preference claims stay with `C.31.ASAP`; causal-use question and verdict stay with `C.28`.

#### C.29:4.2a - Mathematicalization Utility Principle

A mathematical lens is worth introducing only when it changes the working reader's next lens-use action by making at least one first-principles modeling structure visible:

- a declared signature, structure, state variable, transition, or observation map;
- a symmetry, invariant, conservation-like constraint, equivalence, or composition rule;
- a local-global relation, boundary relation, scale variable, coarse-graining rule, scale window, or correspondence condition;
- a variational principle, action, energy, free-energy, loss, or value functional, Euler-Lagrange or stationarity condition, constrained optimization target, dual view, objective vector, or resource trade-off;
- an uncertainty, probability, information, typicality, approximation, sensitivity, or validation boundary;
- an algorithmic, constructive, resource, realizability, implementation, or adversarial limit;
- a bottleneck, obstruction, impossibility, consistency boundary, or failed transfer in the candidate-model space;
- a rival-lens distinction that changes model choice;
- a causal, intervention, or counterfactual preservation question governed by `C.28`;
- a bridge or export loss, governed by `F.9` when semantic correspondence between local senses is needed;
- a measurement or comparability condition governed by `C.16`.

If no next lens-use action changes, keep the text as ordinary prose, downgrade it to a didactic metaphor, or return `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`. A lens that merely makes prose more impressive is not a successful `C.29` result.

#### C.29:4.2b - First-principles lens-family use

`C.29` admits first-principles use only when the principle family changes what the working reader can derive, inspect, compare, observe, or honestly block. The family name is never enough. Each row below is a discovery and recovery discipline: it tells the reader what must be named before claim-bearing mathematical-lens use is bounded for use.

| First-principles family | Use when the working problem asks | Required `C.29` recovery | Stop or neighboring-pattern application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boundary, exterior derivative, Stokes-like local-to-global relation | How local increments, flows, sources, interfaces, or balances compose into a global claim. | Name the domain, boundary, field, form, or flow, derivative, divergence, or curl-like operator, boundary condition, and what is conserved, sourced, or lost at the boundary. | Does not make all boundary language one mechanism; measurement, evidence, and bridge claims are governed by `C.16`, `A.10`, or `F.9`. |
| Cohomology, closed/exact distinction, topological obstruction | Why a local rule cannot be made global, or why a transfer or composition is blocked. | Name the cycle or cocycle-like object, equivalence class or obstruction, local closure condition, failed exactness witness or failed global witness, and the blocked claim. | Useful obstruction is a `LostStructure` or `StopCondition`; it is not a causal explanation without `C.28` and evidence. |
| Symmetry, invariance, equivariance, Noether-like conservation | Which transformations leave the relevant claim unchanged, or which conservation-like quantity follows from an invariance. | Name the transformation family, action on the described variables, invariant or conserved quantity, assumptions, and distinctions intentionally lost. | Does not transfer physical conservation, coordinate-free truth, or causal mechanism without domain evidence relation and dynamics semantics. |
| Variational principle, action, energy, free-energy, loss, or value functional, Legendre or convex duality | Whether a behavior, representation, design, or trade-off follows from stationarity, extremum, dual variables, or potential transformation. | Name the functional, constrained variation space, constraints, boundary conditions, stationarity or extremum condition, dual transform, and what the dual view makes visible. | Does not imply the target literally optimizes that functional unless `A.3.3`, `A.10`, or `C.28` governs the dynamics semantics, evidence relation, or causal use. |
| RG, coarse-graining, fixed point, basin, universality | Why different microdescriptions can share one macropattern, or when a scale claim stops. | Name the scale variable, scale window, coarse-graining rule, fixed point or attractor, basin condition or regularity condition, invariant or exponent, and lost microstructure. | Scale-law adequacy and general method scale-preference claims are governed by `C.18.1` and `C.19.1`; architecture scale-preference claims are governed by `C.31.ASAP`; no micro-mechanism identity is licensed. |
| Diagonal, self-reference, fixed-point theorem, no-go family | Whether a universal evaluator, complete language, self-model, closure rule, or governance rule is blocked by self-application. | Name the encoding, evaluator or self-map, diagonal or fixed-point construction, universal claim being tested, and the impossibility or closure boundary named by value. | Does not prove every recursive-looking case is a no-go theorem; assurance or governance claims are governed by `B.3`, `E.19`, or the local domain pattern. |
| Composition, category, operad, optic, semiring or limit transform | Whether composition, interface, view, transformation, or algebraic law is the useful preserved structure. | Name objects, morphisms or relations, composition law, identity or interface condition, preserved algebraic law, failed transfer, and any limit transform such as classical or tropical or Fourier-Laplace or Legendre. | Bridge semantics and Bridge-dependent substitution safety are governed by `F.9`; C.29 only records the declared lens use and its loss. |
| Probability, information, observation, acquisition | Which uncertainty, information, typicality, readout, or next observation changes the next lens-use action. | Name the random variables or distributions, utility or information criterion, observation or probe design variable, model assumptions, estimation method, validation boundary, and robustness note. | Measurement, evidence, experiment planning, causal-use verdicts, and assurance stay with `C.16`, `A.10`, `C.28`, `A.15`, and `B.3`. |
| Bounded-observer structural information, MDL, epiplexity, compression, or description-recoverability lens | Whether a bounded observer can recover enough selected structure from an architecture description, relation trace, generated graph, reusable-structure accounting result, or other source episteme to change the next lens-use action. | Name the source episteme or trace, observer boundary, candidate information measure or coding scheme, mapping mode, preserved selected structure, lost structure, visible payoff, observation or postulate boundary, and source-return condition. | Does not make epiplexity or compression an architecture characteristic, quality score, selector result, evidence relation, assurance result, OOD guarantee, or causal proof. Architecture, structural-view, reuse-accounting, measurement, evidence, assurance, and bridge claims are governed by `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.30.AD`, `C.31`, `C.31.RSA`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, or `F.9` when those claims are being made. |

This table is normative as a recovery guide, not as a mandatory taxonomy. A local project may name a closer family, but it must recover the same claim-bearing structure: `CandidateMathObject` for the candidate family, preserved structure, lost structure, visible payoff, lens-use boundary value, and stop condition.

P2W and formal-declaration boundary: when one of these families is used in a P2W carry-through from accepted problem-side material into later work, `C.29` still records only the declared mathematical-lens use. A declared formal relation can make mathematical-to-mathematical exactness or near-sameness visible; it does not by itself declare a `FormalSubstrate` signature, `PrincipleFrame`, mechanism, observation-bound world claim, evidence relation, causal-use relation, Bridge-declared lens use, or work. Use `A.6.0` for the `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` declaration, `A.6.1` when mechanism import or realization is being claimed, and `E.18.1` when accepted problem-side material needs a formal declaration for later FPF use.

#### C.29:4.2c - Bounded-observer structural-information lens

Use this subcase when a mathematical lens estimates, compresses, codes, compares, or otherwise exposes how much selected structure a bounded observer can recover from a description, relation trace, generated graph, model, or reusable-structure accounting result. Typical examples include MDL-like two-part codes, epiplexity-style extracted-structure estimates, compression-complexity comparisons, and information-functionals over relation graphs. The EntityOfConcern remains the declared mathematical-lens use, not the architecture, not the description, and not the observer.

Minimum record:

```text
MathLensUse.StructuralInformationLensUse@Context:
  TargetPhenomenon:
  SourceEpistemeOrTraceRef:
  BoundedObserverRef or observerBoundary:

  blockedLensOverread?:
```

When the target is a physical, organizational, or project-world situation, the record must say whether the structural-information claim is observational, postulated, simulated, or only a description-local compression. When the lens is used in architecturing, `C.30` governs architecture as EntityOfConcern, `C.30.ASV` governs structural-view adequacy, `C.30.AD` governs architecture descriptions, and `C.31` or `C.31.RSA` governs modularity or reusable-structure accounting. `C.29` records only the declared lens use: what recoverable structure the mathematical lens makes visible, what it loses, and where that use stops.

#### C.29:4.2d - Architecture-local lens descriptions

Architecture work may use C.29-local descriptions for graph, flow, control, structural-information, RG or coarse-graining, and multilevel-learning or frustration lenses. These names are C.29 output descriptions, not architecture ontology, not proof, and not durable FPF kinds by themselves.

| Local C.29 description | Candidate mathematical object | Visible payoff | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MLU.Description@ArchitectureGraphDSM` | typed graph, hypergraph, DSM, DMM, or MDM matrix | dependencies, clusters, change propagation, and bottlenecks | for semantic interface correctness, compositional quality, or an architecture decision, apply the pattern for that separate claim |
| `MLU.Description@TransformationFlowStructure` | graph, morphism-family, wiring, matrix, or network expression over a selected `TransformationFlowStructure` | flow topology, crossings, carried relations, and path slices without hidden scalarization | for a Work occurrence, gate decision, or evidence claim, apply its subject pattern |
| `MLU.Description@ArchitectureLCA` | layered control structure or multi-rate control model | planner, regulator, plant, observer, feedback timing, and externality separation | stability or causal-use questions require their dynamics, evidence, and `C.28` basis |
| `MLU.Description@EpiplexityStructuralInformation` | bounded-observer structural information or two-part code | learnable reusable structure versus residual or unmodeled structure | establish any utility, assurance, out-of-distribution guarantee, or causal-proof claim through its subject pattern |
| `MLU.Description@RGArchitecture` | scale map over architecture descriptions, fixed-point or basin metaphor, or declared coarse-graining map | scale-stability of an architecture vector and exploding exceptions | a literal physical-RG claim requires its domain theory |
| `MLU.Description@MultilevelLearningFrustration` | multilevel learning over structurally renormalizable descriptions, frustrated optimization landscape, or variational residual model | residual-reducing architecture moves across declared scopes or holon levels | a project-wide optimization claim requires a separately justified global function |

`MLU.Description@RGArchitecture` applies only when the use names a declared aggregation scope, scale variable or scale window, coarse-graining rule, preserved structure, lost structure, source-return condition, declared use, and stop condition. Include a blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. If the claim becomes a scale-preference claim, `C.31.ASAP` governs the architecture preference side; C.29 keeps the declared mathematical-lens use.

Minimum RG architecture description:

```

For architecture work, a common RG-shaped candidate object is:

```text
A_l = (Holons_l, FunctionalRelations_l, FlowRelations_l, ControlRelations_l,
       ModuleRelations_l, InterfaceSpecificationRefs_l, DependencyEdges_l,
       WorkMethodRefs_l, EvidencePackageRefs_l, QualifierRefs_l)

R_l : A_l -> A_{l+1}

`InterfaceSpecificationRefs_l` contains only governed `U.EpistemeRef` values that resolve independently identified `InterfaceSpecification` epistemes under the identifying rule located at A.6.M. The references, their resolution, and the specification content remain separate; changing a lens token or retargeting a reference does not edit the specification.

The index `_l` is a declared aggregation-scope index inside this C.29 lens, not a generic level, tier, layer, or ladder. Each use names the aggregation scope, the coarse-graining rule, the lost structure, and the source-return condition.

`MLU.Description@MultilevelLearningFrustration` applies only when the use names declared holon levels or declared scopes, a mapping between them, conflicting constraints or residuals, preserved structure, lost structure, and the nearest neighboring FPF pattern for any measurement, causal, evidence, assurance, work, selected-set, or decision claim.

Declared lens use: triage, explanation, candidate generation, rival-lens comparison, scale-window reasoning, source-return triggers, and architecture-decision rationale only when the neighboring pattern defines or constrains any non-C.29 claim. Stop or return when the mapping, scale window, preserved structure, or source basis no longer supports the use. A causal-proof, assurance-score, or necessary-complexity-growth claim needs its own argument and source basis. Apply `C.11`, `C.28`, `B.3`, `C.16`, `G.5`, or the applicable stakeholder or ethics pattern when its respective non-C.29 claim is current. Include a project-wide-optimizer or other blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test.

#### C.29:4.3 - Use boundary

This boundary prevents `C.29` from being over-applied.

**Use `C.29` when** a mathematical object, formalism, learned representation, simulation object, or mathematical family is used as a lens for explanation, decision, prediction, publication, comparison, assurance input, bridge, or reusable transfer over a physical, organizational, epistemic, social, computational, scientific, or methodological phenomenon, or when a phenomenon, decision, explanation, comparison, model-selection, diagnosis, or method-choice problem is stable enough that the first useful lens-use action is to choose a cheap candidate lens that makes relevant structure visible.

**Do not use `C.29` as the subject pattern when:**

- the mathematics is ordinary local domain theory already governed by a domain pattern;
- the phrase is a purely didactic analogy that is not reused for decisions, evidence, assurance, publication, bridge, comparison, or transfer;
- the question under repair is causal-use question, causal-use justification, or verdict, which is governed by `C.28`;
- the question under repair is measurement construction, scale construction, direct comparability, or evidence-stub adequacy, which is governed by `C.16`;
- the question under repair is cross-context meaning or Bridge-dependent substitution safety, which is governed by `F.9`;
- the question under repair is dynamics semantics without a separate lens-transfer claim, which is governed by `A.3.3`;
- the question under repair is a `CharacteristicSpace` overlay with no domain-transfer, prediction, assurance, publication, or reusable explanation claim, which stays under `A.19`.
- the use under repair makes a different kind of claim: use `C.11` for a `ChoiceResult` or local choice record; `G.5` for selected-set result declaration; `G.9` for parity or benchmark result claims; `A.15`, `A.15.2`, and `A.15.1` for a selected Method, `U.WorkPlan`, performed `U.Work`, or work-result record; `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for publication occurrence and availability; or `A.15.4` for work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair.
- the use under repair is an explanation-facing rendering, bounded comparative review unit, same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition, or controlled semantic coarsening; those claims stay with `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, or `A.6.3.CSC`, with C.29 fields carrying only mathematical-lens use when the mathematical lens affects the stated declared lens use.
- the claim being made is about forecast, rate, trajectory, rhythm, recovery, convergence, stabilization, speed, temporal window, or rate-change as sufficient for use; temporal-claim adequacy stays with `C.27`.

This boundary keeps mathematical-lens use from becoming a shadow record for neighboring work.

Lexical rule: use **structure-preserving representation** rather than **structure-preserving identification** in discoverability-bearing prose, unless equivalence or identity is explicitly the declared `LensMappingMode`.

#### C.29:4.4 - Output choice before the full card

Begin with action guidance, not with the full card.

First action choices: keep ordinary prose, introduce a cheap candidate lens, name the `CandidateMathObject` or formal position that fits the stated use more directly, add visible payoff, add loss, choose the principal rival lens, add validation regime, narrow an existing claim, downgrade an overclaim, or apply the applicable FPF pattern to any non-lens claim being made.

Memory hook: a successful C.29 application can raise or lower the mathematical claim-bearing use. It can introduce a first candidate lens, keep ordinary domain prose, remove a mathematical lens, repair relation wording through `A.6.P`, declare a `CharacteristicSpace` through `A.19`, use `C.16` for measurement and comparability, apply `F.9` for bridge semantics, ask the `C.28` causal-use question, restore work or source responsibility through `A.15`, or apply `C.27` for temporal-use adequacy.

No-lens cheap output: name the `ProblemStructureCue`, choose the cheapest candidate lens family that makes it visible, test whether that lens changes the next lens-use action, and if no action changes, keep ordinary prose or collect more observations before using mathematical-lens wording.

First neighboring-pattern map:

| Claim-bearing question | Govern there first | C.29 remainder |
|---|---|---|
| relation-precision structure, relation kind, or structure-preserving relation wording | `A.6.P` and local relation patterns; `A.6.RCD` only for the exact residual needed claim after existing direct relations fail | mathematical-lens use only if a mathematical object changes the stated use; C.29 correspondence does not admit or make the relation obtain |
| state variables, transition law, observation map, constraints, or calibration | `A.3.3` and `A.19` | preserved structure and lost structure and lens stop condition |
| measurement construction, scale, unit, polarity, or comparability | `C.16` | lens-use boundary value for measurement-dependent use |
| scale law, universality, knee, exponent, general method-scale preference, or architecture scale preference | `C.18.1` or `C.19.1` for scale-law and general method BLP claims; `C.31.ASAP` for architecture scale-preference claims over a declared alternative set, scale variable, and scale window | scale-bounded mathematical-lens use |
| cross-context meaning, bridge use, or Bridge-dependent substitution use | `F.9` | mathematical structure used inside the bridge claim |
| causal, intervention, policy, or counterfactual use | `C.28` | whether the lens preserves, approximates, or blocks causal-use structure |
| evidence, provenance, source currentness, assurance, release, selector, or benchmark use | `A.10`, `B.3`, or relevant `G.*` pattern | declared mathematical-lens use as one input only |

Subject-pattern boundary: `C.29` coordinates the declared mathematical-lens use across relation-precision structure, state spaces, characteristic spaces, measurement, dynamics, scale, bridge, causal, evidence, assurance, selector, and benchmark patterns. It does not replace any one of them.

1. **Find the claim-bearing phrase.** Mark the mathematical phrase named by value that affects explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance-input, or reusable transfer.
2. **Choose the smallest output class that preserves honesty.** The output-class decision happens before any full-card fields.
3. **Name the concrete mathematical object or structure.** Family labels such as `category theory`, `field`, `graph`, `quantum`, `RG`, or `geometry` are entry prompts, not adequate `CandidateMathObject` values for the stated use by themselves.
4. **State the lens mapping mode.** Use the least committing honest `C.29`-local lens mapping mode: analogy-only prompt, representation, empirical fit, simulation, quotient, abstraction, coarse-graining, embedding, homomorphism, isomorphism, functor-like transfer, cross-context lens-transfer candidate, or accepted local theory. If cross-context meaning, Bridge-dependent substitution, CL, sense cells, or bridge use is being claimed, `F.9` governs that claim; the C.29 fields record only mathematical-lens use for the declared transfer.
5. **State preserved structure and lost structure.** This is the central repair action.
6. **State what becomes visible.** Name the invariant, obstruction, fixed point, symmetry, conservation law, diagnostic boundary, lens-bounded distinction, model-selection consequence, or other payoff.
7. **State the declared lens use and stop or return condition.** Say what the declared lens use now carries, name the next action, and identify the governing FPF pattern that defines or constrains any claim outside that use. Include a blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test.
8. **If the claim does not pass, repair rather than merely fail.** Downgrade, narrow, switch to a principal rival lens, add `LensUseBoundaryValue` or validation regime, split any non-lens claim to its governing FPF pattern, or remove the mathematical phrase from claim-bearing use.

Application output classes:

| Output class | Output | Use condition | Required content |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NoMathLensUseNeeded` | No C.29 output; keep the ordinary local result or Plain orientation | Accepted local mathematics or didactic language makes no separate lens-use claim requiring resolution. | Finish with the local result. A short `NoMathLensUseNeededNote` is useful only when a proposed or disputed lens use needs an explanation; it is not a certificate required for ordinary local mathematics. |
| `LensCandidateNote` | `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` | A problem whose next lens-use action can depend on a mathematical lens is stable enough for a first candidate lens, but no adequate mathematical object has been named yet. | `TargetPhenomenon`, `ProblemStructureCue`, `CandidateLensFamily`, optional `CandidateMathObject?`, `WhyThisLensCouldHelp`, `ExpectedVisiblePayoff`, `ObservableOrControllableCue?`, `NextLensUseAction`, `OrdinaryRivalOrFallback`, `StopCondition`, `NextMathLensUseOutput`. |
| `OneLine` | `MathLensUse.OneLine` | An under-specified phrase affects explanation, decision, prediction, comparison, publication, bridge, assurance input, or reusable transfer and needs repair before reuse. | `TargetPhenomenon`, `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `VisiblePayoff`, `NextLensUseAction`, optional `ObservationOrReadoutNeeded?`, `OrdinaryRivalOrFallback`, `StopCondition`. |
| `MiniCard` | `MathLensUse.MiniCard` | The lens is declared usable for a reusable explanation, local decision, comparison, or method-selection claim. | `OneLine` content plus `InvariantsExposed`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, `declaredLensUse`, optional `blockedLensOverread?`, principal rival, and `RivalLensRelation?` when another mathematical lens changes the bounded lens-use action. |
| `FullCard` | `MathLensUse.FullCard` | Publication, bridge, assurance input, benchmark, model selection, prediction, formal pattern claim, or repeated cross-case use is being made. | Full `MathLensUse.Card@Context` plus any conditional overlays. |
| `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` | `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` | The claim being made is causal use, bridge or substitution, measurement construction, scale construction, direct comparability, evidence-stub adequacy, dynamics semantics, temporal adequacy, decision result, selected method, work plan, performed work, evidence trust, assurance, explanation rendering, comparative review, representation transition, coarsening, scale law, release, selector, or benchmark. | Name the governing FPF pattern and apply `C.28`, `F.9`, `C.16`, `A.3.3`, `C.27`, `C.11`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.4`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `C.18.1`, `C.19.1`, or a relevant G pattern. The C.29 application keeps only the declared lens-use result. |

Micro-template examples:

Architecture and P2W first-use slice:

```text
MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote@ArchitectureP2W := {
  TargetPhenomenon: cooling-fixture deformation problem accepted as a problem-side distinction,
  ProblemStructureCue: heat-flow balance, boundary condition, interface reference plane, and deformation residual change the next architecture or method-choice question,
  CandidateLensFamily: boundary and variational heat-flow lens,
  CandidateMathObject?: temperature field with boundary-condition relation and optional energy functional,
  WhyThisLensCouldHelp: the lens can expose whether the useful distinction is a preserved heat-flow invariant, a boundary-condition mismatch, or a deformation factor outside the model,
  ExpectedVisiblePayoff: decide whether the next honest output is a C.29 one-line lens use, an A.6.0 FormalSubstrate signature declaration, or an E.18.1 P2W carry-through use of the accepted problem-side distinction,
  ObservableOrControllableCue?: boundary temperatures, heat-flow observations, reference-plane assignment, deformation readout,
  NextLensUseAction: write `MathLensUse.OneLine` only after mapping, preserved structure, lost structure, and stop condition are nameable; apply `A.6.0` only when `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` must be declared; apply `E.18.1` only when the accepted problem-side distinction must be used in later FPF work,
  OrdinaryRivalOrFallback: ordinary deformation narrative plus local measurement note,
  StopCondition: keep the candidate note until mapping, preservation, loss, and stop conditions support a one-line use; return to the ordinary deformation narrative if the candidate lens does not change the next action,
  NextMathLensUseOutput: MathLensUse.OneLine or NeighborGoverningPatternNote
}
```

This filled slice is a C.29 first-use output. Declare a formal signature through `A.6.0` and complete P2W carry-through through `E.18.1` when those claims are being made. Use `A.15` for method/Work alignment, `A.15.2` for a work plan, `A.15.1` for performed Work, and `A.15.4` for work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair. Evidence, causal-use, and assurance claims use `A.10`, `C.28`, and `B.3`, respectively.

  WhyThisLensCouldHelp: arrivals, service time, WIP, and waiting time could expose the bottleneck,
  ExpectedVisiblePayoff: decide whether delay is arrival-rate, service-rate, batching, or WIP-boundary pressure,

  NextLensUseAction: observe the variables before claiming queue adequacy,
  OrdinaryRivalOrFallback: ordinary process narrative without queue assumptions,
  StopCondition: stay with the candidate note until observations support queue adequacy; use the ordinary process narrative if the queue candidate does not change the next action,

  declaredLensUse: throughput and latency reasoning inside the declared line model,
  PrincipalRivalLens?: direct empirical dashboard readout,

  StopCondition
}
```

For `MathLensUse.OneLine`, `VisiblePayoff` says what the lens makes visible, such as a bottleneck, invariant, obstruction, incompatibility, loss boundary, or diagnostic split. `NextLensUseAction` says the now-bounded user-facing action, such as compute a local quantity, compare only inside a declared structure, run a validation slice, apply a neighboring pattern, keep the phrase as local metaphor, or remove the phrase from claim-affecting use. `ObservationOrReadoutNeeded?` names the missing observable, readout, assignment, outcome, validation slice, or scale point needed before the repaired line makes the stated action usable. `OrdinaryRivalOrFallback` says what the reader would use without this mathematical lens: ordinary prose, accepted local domain theory, direct measurement, a causal model, a queueing model instead of a quantum-like metaphor, an `A.19` space declaration instead of `C.29`, or an `F.9` bridge instead of category-like wording. If two mathematical lenses already change the next action at this cheap-output class, add one ordinary-language note about the disagreement and use `MathLensUse.MiniCard` or `MathLensUse.FullCard` before claiming a reusable rival-lens relation.

```text
MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote := {

  NextMathLensUseOutput
}
```

`MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` is a cheap first-candidate lens selection note. Its successful next outputs are `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`, `MathLensUse.OneLine`, or a named neighboring subject-pattern note. It is not evidence, assurance, a bridge, a decision record, a selector result, a literature survey, or a full lens-use card.

Name guard for this note: `ProblemStructureCue` is a recognition cue, not a FPF signature; `CandidateLensFamily` is a family prompt, not a kind; `NextLensUseAction` is action guidance, not a work record; `NextMathLensUseOutput` is the next C.29 output class, not a new record family.

Do not use `MathLensUse.OneLine` with an empty `CandidateMathObject`. If the candidate object has not yet been named, use `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` first, keep ordinary prose, or write a `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` when a non-lens claim is being made.

Cheap stop: if the mathematical phrase does not affect any claim beyond orientation, do not use the full card. If the first honest output is `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`, that is a successful `C.29` result, not an underfilled card.

#### C.29:4.4.1 - Output set and declared-use boundary

When a C.29 result is needed, choose its form below. The ordinary non-use branch requires no C.29 output.

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NoMathLensUseNeededNote` | An optional short explanation resolving a proposed or disputed lens use that is unnecessary here. Accepted local mathematics or didactic language alone requires no note. |
| `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` | Cheap first-candidate note for an under-lensed problem whose next lens-use action can depend on a mathematical lens; not evidence and not a full lens-use card. |
| `MathLensUse.OneLine` | Target, mathematical object, lens mapping mode, preserved structure, lost structure, visible payoff, next lens-use action, optional observation or readout needed, ordinary rival or fallback, and stop condition. |
| `MathLensUse.MiniCard` | One-line plus invariant or payoff, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, declared lens use, stop condition, optional grounded overread, and rival-lens relation when disagreement changes the next lens-use action. |
| `MathLensUse.FullCard` | Full card for publication, bridge, assurance input, model selection, benchmark, prediction, or reusable explanation. |
| `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` | A named neighboring FPF pattern defines or constrains the causal, bridge, evidence, scale, dynamics, temporal, decision, work, explanation, comparison, representation, measurement, or assurance claim being made; the C.29 application records only the declared lens-use result. |

Positive warning: a successful `C.29` output makes the mathematical lens honest for its declared use. Any empirical truth, causal-use, bridge, assurance, release, decision, or benchmark claim still needs its governing FPF pattern.

`LensMappingMode`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, and declared lens use are separate fields.

| Lens-use aspect | Question it answers | Where it is recorded |
|---|---|---|
| Mapping construction | How does the mathematical object represent, abstract, embed, quotient, simulate, learn, or transfer the phenomenon? | `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, and any `ScaleWindow?` or `CoarseGrainingRule?`. |
| Lens-use boundary value | What limited lens-use value is declared for this use? | `LensUseBoundaryValue`, validation overlay when validation use is being claimed, and neighboring evidence or assurance patterns when their claims are being made. |
| Declared lens use | What can the working reader now do, and when must the use stop or return? | `declaredLensUse`, `NextLensUseAction`, `StopCondition`, optional `blockedLensOverread?`, and named governing FPF patterns. |

`LensMappingMode` names construction, not permission. Typical local values include `representation`, `abstraction`, `quotient`, `coarse-graining`, `embedding`, `homomorphism`, `isomorphism`, `functor-like transfer`, `simulation`, and `learned or fitted representation`. A broad family name such as graph, field, category, geometry, quantum-like, variational, or Bayesian is only a prompt until the concrete construction and preserved structure and lost structure are named.

`LensUseBoundaryValue` declares only a limited lens-use boundary:

| `LensUseBoundaryValue` value | Declared use | Stop or neighboring-pattern condition |
|---|---|---|
| analogy-only prompt | orientation, hypothesis generation, recognition cue | decision, assurance, causal claim, or publication as established model |
| diagnosticOnly | finding a candidate obstruction, bottleneck, mismatch, missing state variable, or rival-lens split | prediction, decision, causal use, bridge substitution, assurance, or ontology without the neighboring-pattern result named by value |
| formal derivation inside accepted theory | local explanation or theorem-backed transfer when assumptions hold | empirical claim without observation or evidence |
| simulation | candidate model and scenario exploration | real-world causal or predictive reliance without validation |
| empirical fit | local prediction inside validation regime | out-of-regime generalization and causal use |
| accepted domain theory | local domain model use | cross-context ontology import |
| SoTA-echo candidate | structured exploration and lens-use testing | accepted FPF law, assurance, release, or foundation claim |
| mechanized proof | formal property under assumptions | real-world adequacy unless assumptions and evidence hold and any needed semantic Bridge is established |

State the declared lens use in `declaredLensUse` and its stopping or return boundary in `StopCondition`. Elegance, familiarity, source prestige, and mapping type supply no substitute for that declaration. Include `blockedLensOverread?` only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. Any empirical truth, causal-use, bridge, assurance, release, decision, or benchmark claim remains a separate neighboring-pattern claim.

#### C.29:4.4.2 - From lens to local action

Local action change from a mathematical lens is limited to these cases unless a neighboring pattern defines or constrains the needed non-C.29 use:

1. observe or measure a newly named variable or relation;
2. compare only under a declared structure and loss boundary;
3. diagnose a bottleneck, obstruction, mismatch, invariant, or failed transfer;
4. choose or reject a principal rival lens for this local use;
5. narrow, downgrade, or block a tempting overread;
6. apply the governing FPF pattern when a claim being made exceeds the declared lens use.

Each item closes either as a local C.29 output or as a named neighboring-pattern application. If the needed result is a work plan, choice result, selector output, benchmark, or evidence record, publish that neighboring result in its subject pattern rather than from this list.

#### C.29:4.4.3 - No-lens entry: choosing a first candidate lens

Use this when the next lens-use action can benefit from a mathematical lens but no adequate mathematical object has been named. The output is `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote`, not `MathLensUse.OneLine` and not a full card. State the `ProblemStructureCue`, choose one cheap `CandidateLensFamily`, say what it could make visible, name the `ObservableOrControllableCue?` when available, state the `NextLensUseAction`, compare it with the `OrdinaryRivalOrFallback`, and stop if no action changes. If the cue is still pre-articulation and no stable `ProblemStructureCue` can be named, do not mathematize it; preserve cue plurality through `C.2.LS`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`, `B.5.2.0`, or the relevant language-state pattern before applying `C.29`.

Candidate guidance rows are examples for first recognition. Use the row that fits the working cue, or state a closer local cue using the same fields.

| `ProblemStructureCue` | Cheap `CandidateLensFamily` | First bounded lens-use action and stop |
|---|---|---|
| waiting, backlog, bottleneck, or throughput | queue or flow network | Observe arrivals, work in progress, service time, wait time, and bottleneck candidate; do not infer obligation, motivation, or managerial authority from the queueing lens alone. |
| state change, trajectory, stabilization, or control pressure | state-space, dynamics, Markov, ODE, or control lens | Name state, transition law, observation map, and validity window; use `A.3.3` for dynamics semantics, `C.27.TA` for temporal aspects, and `C.27` for temporal-use claims when those claims are being made. |
| conditional-independence boundary, active-inference boundary, Markov blanket, or computational-boundary cue | probabilistic graphical model, Markov-blanket, information-theoretic, active-inference, or contextual-probability lens | Name variables or states, conditional-independence assumption, observation and action partition, model-use boundary, and stop condition; physical boundary, interface module, component, description, and agency-threshold claims remain with their direct patterns. |
| dependency, interface, composition, or transfer failure | graph, hypergraph, category, operad, or compositional lens | Expose edges, edge meaning, slots, interfaces, composition law, and failed transfer; use `F.9` when cross-context meaning or Bridge-dependent substitution is being claimed. |
| local-to-global boundary relation, conservation across a boundary, or source balance or sink balance | Stokes-like, exterior-derivative, divergence, flux, or boundary-operator lens | Name the domain, boundary, local rule, boundary condition, and conserved or sourced quantity; do not infer mechanism, evidence, or bridge safety without the relevant subject pattern. |
| local rule that cannot become a global solution, or a transfer blocked by topology | cohomology, closed/exact distinction, obstruction, or failed-extension lens | Name the local closure condition, global witness that fails, obstruction class or equivalent diagnostic boundary, and the blocked claim. |
| comparison, similarity, distribution shift, population movement, or shape change | metric-space distance, topology, embedding, or optimal-transport lens | Declare what distance, neighborhood, order, embedding, coupling, or transport cost preserves and what it loses; use `C.16` for comparability and measurement construction when those claims are being made. |
| scale transition, coarse behavior, universality, knee, fixed point, or basin-of-attraction cue | coarse-graining, RG, fixed-point, or scaling-law lens | Name scale variable, scale window, coarse-graining rule, fixed point or attractor, basin condition or regularity condition, and invariants; use `C.18.1` for scale-law adequacy, `C.19.1` when general method scale-preference or BLP preference is being claimed, and `C.31.ASAP` when an architecture scale-preference claim is being made. |
| invariance under transformations, coordinate changes, or conservation-like claim | symmetry, group action, Noether-like, invariant, or equivariant representation | Identify the transformations, invariant or conserved quantity, assumptions, distinctions preserved, and coordinate details lost; do not import physical conservation without evidence. |
| extremal behavior, trade-off, dual view, potential, or cost relation or resource relation | variational, Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, action, energy, or free-energy, Legendre, convex-duality, or constrained-optimization lens | Name the functional, variation space, constraints, boundary conditions, stationarity or extremum condition, dual transform, and what the dual view makes visible. |
| self-reference, universal evaluator, complete-language claim, closure paradox, or impossible total method | diagonal, fixed-point theorem, no-go, or self-application lens | Name the encoding, evaluator or self-map, diagonal construction, universal claim tested, and closure or impossibility boundary named by value; do not turn every loop into a no-go theorem. |
| uncertainty, information value, missing observation, active probe, or next sample choice | probabilistic, information-theoretic, BED, OED, active-learning, or Bayesian-optimization lens | Name the variables or distributions, utility or information criterion, design variable, acquisition candidate, model assumptions, estimation method, validation boundary, and robustness note. |
| intervention, policy effect, or counterfactual question | SCM, causal graph, or causal abstraction lens | Name the causal object, intervention or assignment, outcome readout, and whether counterfactual structure is preserved, approximated, or not claimed; keep causal-use question and verdict with `C.28`. |
| learned scientific representation, latent state, surrogate solver, or operator view | neural operator, latent representation, surrogate solver, or world-model lens | Add the observation map, data or training regime, validation slice, generalization claim, uncertainty or approximation note, and stop condition. |
| probe effects, order effects, context effects, incompatible frames, or measurement-as-intervention | quantum-like or contextual-probability lens | Use `C.26` for quantum-like adequacy of claims about order effects, probe effects, or context effects when a named contextual-model obstruction still changes inference or action after the ordinary subject patterns; block physical quantum ontology unless separate physics evidence is supplied. |

`MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` is local first-candidate guidance. It does not replace `G.2` SoTA synthesis, tradition mapping, or broad lens-family review. Use `G.2` when the work being done is tradition-scale source synthesis; use `C.29` when the local need is to choose one cheap candidate lens that changes the next lens-use action. The cheap observation and control check does not apply `C.16` or `A.10` by default; it only asks what the user can observe, read out, assign, vary, or validate now. Measurement construction, evidence relation, intervention-use claim, or validation is still governed by the subject pattern when that claim is being made.

#### C.29:4.4.4 - First honest C.29 entry cases

For E.11-style first-entry recognition, distinguish the working entry case before choosing an output:

| First honest entry case | What the working reader met | First `C.29` answer |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-articulation cue | Something feels structurally wrong, but it is not yet a claim and no stable `ProblemStructureCue` can be named. | Do not impose a mathematical lens. Use `C.2.LS`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`, `B.5.2.0`, or the relevant language-state pattern first; apply C.29 only when the problem structure is stable enough. |
| No lens or under-lensed problem | A problem situation is stable enough for mathematical help, but no `CandidateMathObject` has been named. | Use `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote`: `ProblemStructureCue` -> `CandidateLensFamily` -> `NextLensUseAction`. |
| Under-specified lens | A phrase such as field-like, graph-like, or quantum-like appears, but no object, mapping, preservation, or loss is stated. | Write `MathLensUse.OneLine` or downgrade to ordinary prose. |
| Useful lens with overread | The lens is useful, but the text turns it into ontology, evidence, causality, assurance, bridge, or release authority. | Use `MathLensUse.MiniCard` or `MathLensUse.FullCard` and name blocked use plus neighboring subject pattern. |
| Ordinary local math | A Markov kernel, ODE, graph data structure, or accepted domain theory appears inside its local domain use. | Stay with the local pattern and finish its result without a C.29 note or card. A separate proposed or disputed transfer retains the explanation, lost-condition examination, and validation required by that use. |
| Wrong first pattern | The reader reaches for `C.26`, `F.9`, `C.28`, `C.16`, or `A.3.3` before knowing whether mathematical-lens use is being made, or reaches for `C.29` when a neighbor already governs. | Name the first subject pattern and state what `C.29` contributes, if anything. |

#### C.29:4.4.5 - False-positive bank and entry stops

Do not use a C.29 output for these non-use cases unless a separate lens-transfer, publication, assurance, bridge, comparison, or reusable-explanation claim is being made:

- ordinary ODE inside accepted physics or local engineering model;
- Markov kernel inside accepted stochastic dynamics;
- Markov-blanket wording used only as a recognition cue for a physical interface, interface module, component, boundary description, or viability source after the subject pattern has recovered the claim;
- graph used as a local data structure;
- metric-space distance, topology, order, product, subspace, or embedding declared inside `A.19` `CharacteristicSpace` with no domain-transfer claim;
- category-theoretic proof internal to a domain where that formalism is the local theory;
- one-off pedagogical metaphor not reused for decision, evidence, assurance, publication, bridge, comparison, or transfer.

False-negative bank and pre-articulation boundary: use `C.29` even when no polished mathematical buzzword appears if the working problem has a structure that changes a next lens-use action and ordinary prose is currently hiding it.

| Entry situation | `C.29` applicability | Cheap action |
|---|---|---|
| “Something is off, but we cannot yet say whether it is flow, priority, meaning, or evidence.” | The cue is not stable enough for `ProblemStructureCue`. | Stay in language-state work first; enter `C.29` when the cue is stable enough for `ProblemStructureCue`. |
| “We have many tasks waiting, but cannot see where flow slows.” | Queue or flow structure can expose bottleneck and WIP boundary. | Use `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` for queue or flow; estimate arrivals, service, waiting, and bottleneck. |
| “This comparison feels important, but distance is unclear.” | Metric-space distance, topology, embedding, or transport adequacy is being claimed. | Name what comparison preserves and loses before using the comparison. |
| “We transfer a structure between contexts because it looks the same.” | Mathematical-lens use and possible bridge loss need an account. | Name preserved structure and lost structure and use `F.9` when cross-context meaning or Bridge-dependent substitution is being claimed. |
| “A latent space is used as a scientific explanation.” | A learned lens is being used for scientific explanation. | Name observation map, validation slice, generalization boundary, and stop causal or ontology overread. |
| “The method scales because the mathematics is elegant.” | Scale-law adequacy or BLP preference claim is being made. | Name scale variable or scale window; use `C.18.1` for scale-law adequacy, `C.19.1` for general method scale-preference or BLP preference, and `C.31.ASAP` for architecture scale preference. |

Entry guidance states when `C.29` is the first subject pattern and when another pattern is first:

| Entry situation | First subject pattern | Tempting wrong first pattern |
|---|---|---|
| mathematical-lens use inside a phrase such as "market is a field" | `C.29` | `C.26`, `F.9`, or `A.3.3` before declared lens use is checked |
| explanation-facing rendering that uses a mathematical lens | `E.17.EFP`; `C.29` only for the mathematical-lens use part when that lens affects explanation use | `C.29` as the first pattern for every explanation |
| bounded comparative review unit with a mathematical comparison construction | `E.17.ID.CR`; `C.29` only for declared lens use or rival-lens relation | `C.29` as the comparison or adjudication record |
| same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition | `A.6.3.RT`; `C.29` only if the transition imports a contested or use-affecting mathematical lens | `C.29` for every table, diagram, geometry, or notation shift |
| coarsened rendering useful only under narrower declared lens use and source-bearing reopen | `A.6.3.CSC`; `C.29` only if the coarsening depends on mathematical abstraction or coarse-graining | `C.29` as source-bearing return or bridge relation |
| within-context representation adequacy | `C.29` | `F.9` when no cross-context meaning claim is being made |
| quantum-like dashboard or probe-order claim | `C.26` plus `C.29` compatibility | physical quantum ontology |
| graph state space | `A.19` or `A.3.3` unless lens transfer is explicit | `C.29` for every graph word |
| category bridge across contexts | `F.9` for bridge semantics; `C.29` only for the declared mathematical-lens-use account | duplicate bridge semantics inside `C.29` |
| prediction, rate, trajectory, recovery, convergence, or rhythm claim | `C.27` when temporal adequacy is being claimed; `C.29` only for declared lens use | treating a mathematical prediction cue as enough for temporal-use adequacy |
| decorative scale language | no `C.18.1` or `C.19.1` unless scale behavior is being claimed | scale-law review for every scale word |

C.29 entry stops are: no C.29 output needed, `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` used to select a first candidate, `MathLensUse.OneLine` used, or a neighboring subject pattern applied.

#### C.29:4.4.6 - Subject-pattern boundary table

A `C.29` application uses this subject-pattern discipline so mathematical-lens use stays in the C.29 discipline rather than becoming a second authority over neighboring claims.

Positive claim kind:

> A C.29 application gives a pattern-local adequacy discipline for claims that use a mathematical object, formalism, learned representation, simulation object, or mathematical family as a mathematical lens for a stated use. The application asks for candidate mathematical object, lens mapping mode, preserved and lost structure, visible invariant or distinction, `LensUseBoundaryValue` or validation regime, declared lens use, any justified blocked overread, and stop or return condition.

Boundary application rule: when the claim being made is a choice result, work plan, evidence relation, assurance tuple, explanation rendering, comparative review unit, representation shift, temporal claim, bridge, causal-use claim, measurement claim, scale-law claim, selector, or benchmark, the `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` names the governing FPF pattern and project-side record. A C.29 application can contribute a lens-bounded prediction, distinction, obstruction, diagnostic boundary, or rival-lens note that the governing record can cite; it does not create that neighboring record.

Mathematical object or learned representation read as world structure: if a model state, embedding, simulator, category, graph, tensor object, vector-store relation, or learned representation is being used as a mathematical lens for a phenomenon, C.29 records only the declared mathematical-lens use. The output must name `TargetPhenomenon`, `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `LensUseBoundaryValue` or validation boundary, declared lens use, and `StopCondition`. Measurement, evidence, assurance, dynamics, causal-use, formal-substrate, characteristic-space, publication, benchmark, selector, work, gate, release, or decision claims remain with the subject pattern named in the table below.



| Object or claim being made | Governing FPF pattern | C.29 contribution |
|---|---|---|
| mathematical-lens use | `C.29` | Names the C.29 discipline: candidate mathematical object, lens mapping mode, preserved structure and lost structure, invariant or distinction, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, declared lens use, any justified blocked overread, and stop or return condition. |
| durable reusable names beyond pattern-local fields | `F.18` | Cite when `MathLensUse` names become durable beyond C.29-local use. |
| broad wording and epistemic precision restoration | `F.19`, `E.10`, `C.2.P` | Use F.19 for ordinary precise-plain-language repair, E.10 for cues and unresolved wording, and C.2.P for unresolved epistemic meaning. |
| relation precision, arity, polarity, needed-claim derivation, and slot structure | `A.6.P`, `A.6.RCD`, `A.6.5` | Apply the direct relation and derivation governors first. C.29 applies only if a mathematical object represents the settled claim or derivation and changes the stated lens use. |
| object, description, and carrier distinction | `A.7` | Do not identify the phenomenon directly with the mathematical object. |
| dynamics state space and transition law | `A.3.3` | Assess imported or contested lens use; do not govern dynamics semantics. |
| `CharacteristicSpace`, slots, topology, order, and metric-space distance overlays | `A.19` | Apply only when an overlay becomes a domain-transferring or publication-bearing lens. |
| Decision, selector-result, benchmark-result, or publication-availability claim | `C.11` for a `ChoiceResult` or local choice record; `G.5` for selected-set result declaration; `G.9` for parity or benchmark result use; `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source; and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability | Can contribute a lens-bounded prediction, distinction, obstruction, diagnostic boundary, or rival-lens note; it does not make the decision, result, or publication claim. |
| selected method, method-family selection, `U.WorkPlan`, performed `U.Work`, work-result record, or work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair | `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.4` | Can contribute method-relevant lens use; method, plan, performed Work, and any result record stay with their direct patterns, while A.15.4 only repairs reliance on a misleading appearance. |
| evidence relation, source currentness, provenance, evidence carrier, or model card or datasheet used as evidence | `A.10` | States `LensUseBoundaryValue` only; evidence relations and provenance remain A.10 matters. |
| assurance, readiness, reliability, release confidence, safety, trust, or engineering justification | `A.15.5` for work-entry readiness; `A.10` for evidence reliance; `B.3` only for an actual named assurance claim; the direct domain pattern for other readiness, reliability, release, safety, trust, or engineering-justification claims, plus relevant G patterns when their claims are made | Treats declared lens use as possible input only; mathematical elegance does not raise assurance. |
| measurement construction, scale, unit, or comparability, or evidence-stub adequacy | `C.16` | States measurement-dependent `LensUseBoundaryValue` only; measurement construction, scale, unit, or polarity, direct comparability, and evidence-stub adequacy stay with `C.16`. |
| explanation-facing rendering or generated explanation use | `E.17.EFP` | States mathematical-lens use for the mathematical explanation used inside the rendering; explanation-use discipline stays with `E.17.EFP`. |
| bounded comparative review unit | `E.17.ID.CR` | States declared lens use for a mathematical comparison construction or rival lens when that construction affects the comparative review use. |
| same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition | `A.6.3.RT` | Applies only if the representation shift imports a contested or use-affecting mathematical lens. |
| coarsened rendering with narrower declared lens use and source-bearing reopen | `A.6.3.CSC` | Applies only if the coarsening depends on mathematical abstraction, quotienting, or coarse-graining. |
| cross-context meaning, bridge kind, direction, CL, loss, and substitution | `F.9` | Reference the Bridge and its separate bounded-use claim; keep Bridge semantics in `F.9`. |
| causal-use question or verdict | `C.28` | Block causal overread or cite a `C.28` application or `CausalUseSupportResultRef`. |
| forecast, rate, trajectory, rhythm, recovery, convergence, stabilization, temporal window, or rate-change used as sufficient for a use | `C.27` | Can state a prediction-relevant or distinction-relevant mathematical-lens use; temporal-claim adequacy stays with `C.27`. |
| scale-law and Bitter-Lesson preference claims | `C.18.1`, `C.19.1`, `C.31.ASAP` | Cite scale-window, scale-law, BLP, or architecture scale-preference evidence when scale behavior, general method scale preference, or architecture scale preference is being claimed. |
| quantum-like modeling | `C.26` | Treat `C.26` as C.29-compatible specialization, not as full-card inheritance for every QL-lite note. |
| Selector and benchmark results, parity and SoTA packs, and model-selection publications | `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.2`, `G.10`, `E.17`, and `E.24.PUB` when publication is current | Use `G.5` and `G.9` for selector and benchmark result content, `G.2` and `G.10` for SoTA-pack and shipping claims, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for an actual publication occurrence and availability. A `MathLensUse.*` card can contribute declared lens use for a selector or benchmark input only. |

#### C.29:4.5 - `MathLensUse.Card@Context` shape

`MathLensUse.Card@Context` is a pattern-local card in `C.29`. It is not `U.MathLensUseCard`, `U.LensUseRecord`, or any universal `U.*` kind.

Namespace note: `MathLensUse.Card@Context`, `MathLensUseOutputRef`, `MathLensUse.OneLine`, `MathLensUse.MiniCard`, `MathLensUse.FullCard`, and `CC-C29-*` are `C.29`-local instruments unless they cite existing FPF kinds or refs. `MathLensUseOutputRef` references the applicable `C.29` output for the stated use; it is not a demand for `MathLensUse.FullCard`. Do not mint generic suffixes such as `SystemMathLensUse`, `MathLensUseQuality`, or `MathLensUseCompliance`. Durable cross-pattern `MathLensUse.*` names, records, or refs require explicit minting or reuse plus naming, kind, and design-rationale decisions through `F.8`, `F.18`, `C.3`, and `E.9`; otherwise they remain pattern-local labels.

Read `MathLensUse.Card@Context` through three aspects:

| Aspect | Fields or refs | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Selected mathematical representation and lens mapping | `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `InvariantsExposed` | Names the selected mathematical object and the representation or correspondence used for the C.29 account; does not assert world-side participation, identify the phenomenon with the mathematical object, or replace an `A.6.0` FormalSubstrate signature. |
| Use boundary and validation | `LensUseBoundaryValue`, `ValidationUseOverlayRef?`, `LearnedLensOverlayRef?`, failure case, uncertainty or approximation note | States the lens-use boundary value for this lens use; does not create an evidence relation, benchmark result, assurance, or release confidence. |
| FPF use and boundaries | `declaredLensUse`, `StopCondition`, `blockedLensOverread?`, `BridgeRefSet?`, `CausalUseDisposition?`, `AssuranceUseDisposition?`, `ExportPolicyRef?` | States what the reader may do, when to stop or return, and which governing FPF patterns define or constrain neighboring claims. |

Validity boundary: mathematical validity of the object under its assumptions is not the same as representational adequacy to the phenomenon; representational adequacy is not empirical validation for a use; empirical validation is not a causal-use verdict; a causal-use verdict is not assurance, release confidence, decision sufficiency, or benchmark superiority.

```text
MathLensUse.FullCard base fields:
MathLensUse.Card@Context := {
  TargetPhenomenon,
  entityOfConcernRef?,
  BoundedContext,
  CandidateMathObject,
  LensMappingMode,
  PreservedStructure,
  LostStructure,
  InvariantsExposed,
  LensBoundedPredictionOrDistinction?,
  LensUseBoundaryValue,
  declaredLensUse,
  StopCondition,
  blockedLensOverread?
}
```

Conditional fields apply only when the corresponding neighboring claim, claim-bearing use, or publication use is being made:

```text
MathLensUse.FullCard conditional fields := {
  DynamicsRef?,
  TransitionLawRef?,
  ObservationMapRef?,
  ScaleWindow?,
  CoarseGrainingRule?,
  SourceReturnCondition?,
  PublicationUseClassification?,
  PrincipalRivalLens?,
  RivalLensSet?,
  RivalLensRelation?,
  ValidationUseOverlayRef?,
  LearnedLensOverlayRef?,
  BridgeRefSet?,
  CausalUseDisposition?,
  AssuranceUseDisposition?,
  ExportPolicyRef?
}
```

**Plain card gloss.** A useful mathematical lens says: what phenomenon is being seen, through which mathematical object, by what mapping, what survives, what is lost, what becomes visible, what lens-use boundary value and validation boundary make this use bounded, the now-bounded user-facing action, any justified blocked user inference, and where the lens stops.

#### C.29:4.5a - Conditional overlays

The base card stays light. These overlays are used only when their corresponding use is being made. Ordinary C.29 use does not fill this block; it escalates here only when the claim is already publication-facing, assurance-input, benchmark, bridge, model-selection, prediction, scientific or model, learned-lens, or causal-use facing.

```text
MathLensUse.ValidationUseOverlay@Context :=
⟨
  ClaimUse,
  ValidationRegime,
  EvaluationSlice,
  ApproximationOrUncertaintyNote,
  KnownFailureCaseOrCounterexample,
  SensitivityOrRobustnessNote?,
  DomainOfApplicability,
  OutputChangeCondition?
⟩
```

Use the validation overlay when the lens is used for prediction, publication, assurance input, benchmark use, model selection, or scientific claim or model claim. `LensUseBoundaryValue` alone is then insufficient. Keep the neighboring notions separate: verification is proof or formal checking under stated assumptions; validation is fit for a declared use and regime; calibration aligns model parameters or readouts with observations; explanation states why the lens makes a distinction intelligible. The C.29 output does not let any one of these four labels silently stand in for the others.

```text
MathLensUse.LearnedLensOverlay@Context :=
⟨
  DataOrTrainingRegime,
  ObservationMapRef,
  GeneralizationClaim,
  DiscretizationOrResolutionPolicy?,
  ValidationRegime,
  ApproximationOrUncertaintyNote,
  StopCondition
⟩
```

Use the learned-lens overlay when the mathematical object is fitted, learned, latent, simulation-trained, data-derived, a neural operator, a surrogate solver, an embedding, or a world-model representation.

Use the following learned-lens stop variants when the declared use reaches the corresponding boundary. Include a separate guard only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test:

| Tempting overread | Stop condition form |
|---|---|
| out-of-distribution generalization | no generalization outside the declared validation regime |
| causal mechanism | no causal mechanism claim without `C.28` and evidence relation |
| latent dimension ontology | latent coordinate or factor is not an entity kind without separate ontology and evidence |
| unobserved-variable recovery | no recovery of hidden variables beyond the declared observation map and validation slice |
| benchmark superiority | no benchmark or selector superiority outside the declared evaluation slice and relevant `G.*` record |
| assurance or release use | require the corresponding assurance, release, or reliability result under its direct subject pattern; use `A.10` for evidence reliance, `B.3` only for an actual named assurance claim, and relevant G patterns for their claims |

```text
MathLensUse.CausalAbstractionCheck@Context :=
⟨
  LensMappingMode,
  InterventionStructureStatus ∈ {preserved, approximated, notClaimed},
  CounterfactualUseStatus ∈ {preserved, approximated, notClaimed},
  C28ApplicationRef?
⟩
```

This is not a first-class causal abstraction card. It is a lightweight check: when `LensMappingMode` is abstraction, quotient, coarse-graining, macro-model, or simulation, and `declaredLensUse` would include intervention, policy, counterfactual, or causal explanation, apply `C.28` for causal-use question and verdict.

#### C.29:4.5b - Repair decision table

| Failed or missing item | Required repair |
|---|---|
| no `CandidateMathObject` | If the problem still needs a mathematical lens for the next lens-use action, first name the `ProblemStructureCue` and write a `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote` with the cheapest candidate lens family and next lens-use action; downgrade to ordinary prose or remove the mathematical claim only when no candidate lens changes action. |
| no `LensMappingMode` | Choose a lens mapping mode or downgrade to analogy-only prompt. |
| no `PreservedStructure` | Remove the claim-bearing mathematical phrase. |
| no `LostStructure` | Add a loss note, downgrade, or justify an equivalence or isomorphism claim through the subject pattern. |
| no invariant, obstruction, distinction, or payoff | Keep the phrase as didactic recognition cue or orientation-only. |
| no `LensBoundedPredictionOrDistinction` where decision, prediction, or model selection is being claimed | Block decision or assurance use; downgrade to analogy-only if no declared lens-use consequence is named. |
| evidence is analogy-only | Block decision, publication-as-established-model, assurance, release, and causal use unless evidence relation, validation regime, causal-use relation, or assurance result is supplied by its subject pattern. |
| no `LensUseBoundaryValue` | Block decision, publication, assurance, benchmark, and release use. |
| causal, intervention, policy, or counterfactual overread | Apply `C.28` or block causal use. |
| cross-context meaning, export, or substitution overread | Apply `F.9` when the export or substitution needs semantic correspondence between local senses; otherwise use the direct subject pattern. Block unsupported export or substitution. |
| scale, universality, knee, exponent, or scale-advantage claim | Apply `C.18.1` for scale-law adequacy, `C.19.1` for general method scale preference, or `C.31.ASAP` for architecture scale preference when that claim is made; otherwise keep the lens local and bounded by stop condition. |
| assurance or release use | Apply the direct release pattern, `A.10` for evidence reliance, `B.3` only for an actual named assurance claim, or relevant G patterns for their claims; block unsupported assurance or release use. |
| `StopCondition` is generic | Name the condition for narrowing or stopping, a no-lens exit, or source-return trigger. Include a blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. |

#### C.29:4.6 - Field meanings

| Field | Meaning selected for `C.29` | Boundary guard |
|---|---|---|
| `TargetPhenomenon` | Plain entry prompt naming the phenomenon or situation to be understood. | Not a `U.Kind`, not by itself the exact EntityOfConcern designation of a claim-bearing episteme, and not by itself a publication-side designation or claim about that phenomenon. |
| `entityOfConcernRef?` | EntityOfConcern reference named by value when the lens appears inside a claim-bearing episteme, `PublicationUnit`, benchmark, bridge, or assurance-bearing statement. | Required only when the lens appears in a claim-bearing episteme, `PublicationUnit`, benchmark, bridge, or assurance-bearing statement. |
| `BoundedContext` | Context in which the lens is claimed to work. | Cite `F.9` when the use needs semantic correspondence between local senses. |
| `CandidateMathObject` | Concrete mathematical object, structure, formal position, learned representation, or local formalism. | Broad family labels are prompts until narrowed. |
| `LensMappingMode` | `C.29`-local lens mapping mode. | Stays separate from `F.9` BridgeKind, `A.6.P` `RelationKind`, `C.3` kind, and domain relation kinds; cross-context transfer uses `F.9` when bridge semantics are being claimed. |
| `PreservedStructure` | Structure preserved by the lens in the declared use. | No preserved structure means the mathematical phrase cannot justify the stated use. |
| `LostStructure` | Structure the lens drops, abstracts away, or does not preserve. | Empty loss requires explicit equivalence or isomorphism justification through the subject pattern. |
| `InvariantsExposed` | Invariant, obstruction, fixed point, symmetry, conservation law, diagnostic boundary, or other payoff. | If no payoff is visible, downgrade to recognition cue. |
| `ObservableOrControllableCue?` | Cheap cue naming what can be observed, read out, assigned, varied, or validated before a candidate lens can change action. Examples include arrivals, work in progress, service time, wait time, edge meaning, intervention assignment, outcome readout, observation map, validation slice, scale variable, or scale point. | Not a measurement construction, evidence record, causal-use result, or validation verdict. Apply `C.16`, `A.10`, `C.28`, or `A.3.3` when those claim types are being made. |
| `ObservationOrReadoutNeeded?` | Optional one-line note naming the observable, readout, assignment, outcome, validation slice, or scale point still needed before the stated bounded lens-use action is justified. | If the account of this missing item makes a measurement, evidence, causal, dynamics, or validation claim, apply the neighboring pattern that governs that claim. |
| `LensBoundedPredictionOrDistinction?` | Required when prediction, decision, method selection, model selection, or publication-as-model is being claimed. | Not required for orientation-only use. |
| `DynamicsRef?`, `TransitionLawRef?` | References to dynamics defined by `A.3.3` when dynamics semantics are being claimed. | `C.29` does not define dynamics. |
| `ObservationMapRef?` | Probe, readout, or observation map when observation makes the declared lens use bounded enough for the stated claim. | Required when learned or measurement-dependent lens use is being made. |
| `ScaleWindow?`, `CoarseGrainingRule?` | Scale range and coarse-graining or compression rule when scale behavior, macro description or effective description, universality, coarse behavior, latent compression, or renormalized description is being claimed. | `C.18.1` and `C.19.1` govern scale-law and BLP evidence; the C.29 output states only how the lens remains adequate inside the declared window. |
| `SourceReturnCondition?` | Condition under which the reader must return from the compressed or coarse description to the source-domain variables, observations, cases, or mechanisms. | Required only when abstraction, coarse-graining, compression, latent representation, or macro-modeling drops source-domain distinctions that could matter to the stated use. |
| `PublicationUseClassification?` | Optional note for publication-facing use: `orientationOnly`, `explanationFacing`, `comparisonInput`, `decisionInputCandidate`, `benchmarkInput`, `assuranceInputCandidate`, or `reusableModelPublication`. | Does not publish, release, benchmark, assure, or decide anything by itself; the governing publication, benchmark, evidence, decision, and assurance patterns still govern those claims. |
| `OutputChangeCondition?` | Condition under which this C.29 output must be narrowed, demoted, replaced, retired from claim-bearing use, or handed to a neighboring FPF pattern. | Not a process log or standing state-family record; it states a result boundary for the lens use being made. |
| OrdinaryRivalOrFallback | Ordinary prose, accepted local theory, direct measurement, or simpler neighboring-pattern application the reader would use without this lens. | Required for cheap outputs; prevents prestige bias before broad rival review. |
| `PrincipalRivalLens?` | Default ordinary or most relevant rival lens. | Preferred over a broad literature survey. |
| `RivalLensSet?` | Broader comparison set only when publication, selection, or claim-bearing comparison is being made. | Not a `G.5` selector, benchmark harness, or parity result. |
| `RivalLensRelation?` | Declared relation between the lens in this use and the principal rival or rival set being compared. Allowed local relation values include `ordinaryFallback`, `complementary`, `sameUseLowerCost`, `morePreservedStructureHigherCost`, `lowerErrorOnDeclaredEvaluationCriterion`, `clearerExplanationForDeclaredReader`, `bridgeNeedsF9`, `causalUseNeedsC28`, `differentScaleWindow`, `differentLossProfile`, `incomparableForCurrentUse`, `blockedByStopCondition`, and `unresolved`. Examples: a queueing lens and a causal lens can be complementary for different lens-use actions; a latent manifold and a causal graph can conflict when latent axes are read causally; an RG-like lens and a micro-dynamics lens can have different scale windows. | Names disagreement only; a C.29 output is not a winning-lens choice, literature review, selector result, benchmark result, or parity result. Any superiority claim names the evaluation criterion, reader, cost, scale window, or subject pattern that makes the comparison bounded for use. |
| `LensUseBoundaryValue` | Local finite lens-use boundary field. | Not evidence, an EvidenceGraph, a PathId, or an assurance score. |
| `BridgeRefSet?` | Reference to `F.9` Bridge material when semantic correspondence between local senses is needed. | Bridge semantics stay with `F.9`. |
| `CausalUseDisposition?` | One of `noCausalUseClaim`, `causalUseBlocked`, `C28ApplicationRef`, or `CausalUseSupportResultRef`. | No causal-reference shortcut; no causal verdict from `C.29`. |
| `AssuranceUseDisposition?` | One of `noAssuranceUseClaim`, `assuranceUseBlocked`, `evidenceInputOnly`, `A10Ref`, or `B3ApplicationRef`. | No assurance verdict from mathematical elegance. |
| `declaredLensUse` | Declared lens use in this C.29 application. | Matches evidence and validation regime. |
| `blockedLensOverread?` | Optional tempting neighboring use that is blocked or governed by another subject pattern; include it only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. | Names the neighboring pattern when that neighboring claim is being made. `groundedLensOverread?` is an alias for this same optional value. |
| `StopCondition` | Condition for narrowing, stopping, returning to source material, or applying the direct pattern for a neighboring claim. | States the concrete boundary of the declared lens use. |
| `ExportPolicyRef?` | Governed reuse or export policy when publication or downstream reuse is being claimed. | Not required for local orientation or mini-card use. |

### C.29:5 - Neighboring-pattern boundaries

Neighboring patterns remain necessary and are not displaced. A retained neighboring-pattern application note answers the working question for the neighboring pattern being used: what does the reader do with the mathematical lens now? State the neighboring-pattern trigger and the first bounded lens-use action for that neighboring pattern. If a note only repeats that C.29 does not replace a neighbor, keep that boundary in the C.29 subject-pattern table instead of copying generic boundary prose into the neighboring pattern:

- `A.6.P` handles relation precision restoration.
- `A.3.3` handles dynamics semantics.
- `A.19` handles characteristic spaces, overlays, normalization, and comparability.
- `F.9` handles cross-context semantics and Bridge loss.
- `C.18.1` and `C.19.1` handle scale-law and BLP claims.
- `C.26` handles one specific quantum-like lens family.
- `C.28` handles causal-use question and verdict.
- `A.10` and `B.3` handle evidence and assurance.
- `C.11`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, and `A.15.4` handle choice results, method and work separation, work plans, performed work, and work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair.
- `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, and `A.6.3.CSC` handle explanation-facing renderings, bounded comparative review units, same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transitions, and controlled semantic coarsening.
- `C.27.TA` handles temporal aspects; `C.27` handles temporal-claim adequacy.

Use the C.29 discipline when the question under repair is: **Is this mathematical lens adequate for this declared use, and where does it stop?**

### C.29:6 - Naming, ontology, and epistemic precision-restoration account

#### C.29:6.1 - Name

Name: `C.29 — Mathematical Lens Use`.

Local namespace: `MathLensUse` = **Mathematical Lens Use**. The pattern-local card and reference namespace uses `MathLensUse`; checklist IDs use `CC-C29-*`.

The stable name is `Mathematical Lens Use` because `C.29` governs a declared use and its use boundary. Plain prose can still say that a useful mathematical lens compresses many cases while preserving declared distinctions; claim-bearing use is recovered through `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, and `StopCondition`.

#### C.29:6.1a - C.29-local naming guard

`MathLensUse.*` instruments are `C.29`-local unless separately admitted. They are not `U.*` kinds, not durable FPF record families, and not substitutes for `U.Kind`, `KindSignature`, `KindBridge`, `BridgeCard`, `EvidenceGraph`, `ChoiceResult`, `U.WorkPlan`, `U.Work`, or assurance records.

Do not mint `LensKind`, `MathLensKind`, `MathLensUseQuality`, `MathLensUseCompliance`, or `MathLensUseRecord` from `C.29` use.

When one `C.29` application needs a mathematical-lens name to become reusable outside that application, use `F.18` local-first naming; when it quantifies over a class of described entities, use `C.3` Kind-CAL; when it creates or reuses a durable concept or record family, use `F.8` minting or reuse and `E.9` design-rationale discipline.

#### C.29:6.2 - Tempting wrong names rejected

| Tempting name | Reason rejected |
|---|---|
| `Mathematical Ontology Principle` | Smuggles the metaphysical claim `C.29` rejects. |
| `Single-Foundation Math Stance` | Would collapse plural lens families into one foundation claim; C.29 instead tests each selected family by declared mapping, local use, and recoverable loss. |
| `Math Metaphor Adequacy` | Too narrow and too vague; the selected answer is structure-preserving representation, not mere metaphor. |
| `Quantum-Like Generalization` | Misplaces the general pattern under one special lens. |
| `Category-Theoretic Bridge Pattern` | Over-privileges category theory; C.29 is broader. |

#### C.29:6.3 - Ontology guard selected for FPF

> A physical, organizational, or epistemic phenomenon is not directly identified with a mathematical object; it is represented through a mathematical object by an explicitly declared mapping that preserves some structures and loses others.

#### C.29:6.4 - C.2.P recoveries applied

| Earlier wording risk | Recovered wording in `C.29` |
|---|---|
| `source` or `target` | Use source material, cited source-use row, `entityOfConcernRef`, governing FPF pattern, `BridgeRefSet`, or pattern reference named by value as appropriate. |
| raw source intake as evidence | Recovered as source text and source-use rows, not authority. Selected content is integrated through `C.29:13a`, `C.29:13`, and the field rows and checklist rows for its claim being made. |
| `structure-preserving identification` | Rewritten to `structure-preserving representation or mapping` unless direct equivalence is explicitly the `LensMappingMode`. |
| Source compound fields that merge dynamics reference and transition-law reference | Rewritten as separate `DynamicsRef?` and `TransitionLawRef?` fields. |
| Procedure-like pattern-control language | Rewritten as `pattern application`, `Disposition`, `BridgeRefSet`, `C28ApplicationRef`, or `CausalUseSupportResultRef` only when that neighboring-pattern application or causal-use record ref is being cited. |
| `ExportPolicy` | Split into `declaredLensUse`, `StopCondition`, optional `blockedLensOverread?`, and optional `ExportPolicyRef?`. |
| free intensity qualifier | Replace with named adequacy fields, evidence relation, scale construction, comparability construction, lens-use boundary value, and stop-condition wording. |
| `model`, `lens`, `math` as prestige heads | Recovered as `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, and `LensUseBoundaryValue`. |
| Causal or assurance implications | Recovered as `CausalUseDisposition?` and `AssuranceUseDisposition?`, with `C.28`, `A.10`, `B.3`, and G-patterns as neighboring governors. |

### C.29:7 - Archetypal Grounding

| Archetype | Candidate lens | Preservation | Loss | Output and stop condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Production line as queueing network | Queueing network | flow, service rates, bottlenecks, waiting time | human motivation, contractual duties, rare events not modeled | `MathLensUse.MiniCard`; admits throughput and latency reasoning; narrow or stop when the stated assumptions fail or the use depends on an omitted feature. |
| Team backlog as queue | Queueing lens | work arrival, work in progress, service time, waiting time | obligation, motivation, priority legitimacy, skill learning | `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card; admits bottleneck reasoning; moral or managerial authority, when claimed, needs its own basis. |
| Manager sees slow throughput but has no lens | Queue or flow candidate note | possible arrivals, work in progress, service bottleneck, waiting time | motivation, duty, priority legitimacy, full team ontology | Start with `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote`; use `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card only after the candidate queue or flow lens changes the next lens-use inspection. |
| Measurement comparison as declared distance or scoring choice | Metric-space distance, embedding, or scoring-function lens | comparability, distance, proximity, clustering, threshold structure | evidence relation, causal mechanism, value judgment | `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card; admits comparison design and sensitivity checks, not truth or priority by itself. |
| Stabilizing system as state-space dynamics | State-space or transition lens | state variables, transition relation, attractor, control handle when the neighboring relation is named by value | unobserved motivation, obligation, causal mechanism beyond the model | `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card; admits state inspection or transition inspection, not full dynamics ontology. |
| Research field as citation graph or category-like network | Graph or categorical structure | adjacency, composition, interface, failed transfer, citation or transformation patterns | semantic truth, evidence relation, social meaning | First inspect adjacency, composition, interface, or failed transfer; `MathLensUse.MiniCard` plus `F.9` when the use needs semantic correspondence between local senses; never substitute graph proximity for truth or evidence. |
| Quantum-like dashboard | Quantum-like probe and order lens | order effects, probe effects, incompatible frames when actually present | physical quantum ontology | `C.26` with C.29-compatible stop condition `QL-NQ`; not a full-card cost for QL-lite notes. |
| RG-like scale-law claim | Coarse-graining or fixed-point lens | scale variable, coarse-graining rule, invariants across scales | micro-mechanism identity and universal applicability | `C.29` plus `C.18.1` or `C.19.1`; stops outside scale window. |
| Learned operator as scientific lens | Learned operator, latent space, surrogate solver | trained input-output structure, resolution behavior when validated | causal mechanism, out-of-domain generalization, unobserved variables | Learned-lens overlay; validation regime and stop condition required. |

Worked micro-cases by failure mode:

| Failure mode | Reader sees | C.29 repair |
|---|---|---|
| No-lens repair | "Throughput is slow, but we have no model." | Start with a queue or flow `MathLensUse.LensCandidateNote`; observe arrivals, work in progress, service time, wait time, and bottleneck candidate before using `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card. |
| Under-specified-lens repair | "The market is a field." | Write `MathLensUse.OneLine` only if the candidate mathematical object, mapping, preserved structure, lost structure, payoff, and stop condition can be stated; otherwise remove the phrase or keep it as ordinary metaphor. |
| Overread repair | "The latent manifold explains reality." | Use the learned-lens overlay, name observation map and validation slice, and stop causal or ontology overread unless an exact causal or ontological predicate is defined and current facts satisfy it. |
| Wrong-neighbor repair | "The same graph appears in two contexts, so the meanings are the same." | Apply `F.9` for Bridge semantics; keep `C.29` only for mathematical-lens use. |
| Local-math non-use | Accepted Markov kernel inside local dynamics. | Stay in `A.3.3`; return `NoMathLensUseNeededNote` if useful; do not use C.29 merely because local mathematics appears. |
| Speculative SoTA stress | Vanchurin-style universe-as-learning. | Treat as candidate-lens stress, not accepted physics, foundation, assurance, or release input. |

Vanchurin-style universe-as-learning is not an ordinary first grounding archetype. Keep it in the validation harness and SoTA use as a candidate stress test: it can teach overclaim control and adapt-not-adopt discipline, but it does not ground accepted physics, assurance, quantitative law, or routine lens use.

### C.29:8 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias risk | C.29 correction |
|---|---|
| **Mathematical prestige bias** | Require `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, and `StopCondition`. |
| **Physics envy** | Physical source-domain ontology does not transfer without separate proof or evidence and subject pattern. |
| **Category-theory monoculture** | Use category-theoretic material only when composition, interfaces, views, transformations, or transport structure matters to the stated use; otherwise choose the local lens family that exposes the working cue. |
| **Speculation laundering** | Vanchurin enters as candidate lens or SoTA-echo, not accepted fact. |
| **Over-formalization** | Low-consequence analogy can remain local prose; reusable or decision-bearing lens needs a `MathLensUse.*` card. |
| **Dry ontology drift** | Keep Plain explanations where they improve recognition, but recover claim-bearing commitments through fields named by value or a named neighboring pattern. |
| **Scale blindness** | Require `ScaleWindow?`; coordinate scale claims with `C.18.1` or `C.19.1`. |
| **Causal laundering** | If the lens licenses causal claims, apply `C.28`; MathLensUse cannot supply causal use by itself. |
| **Assurance laundering** | Mathematical elegance does not raise `R`; evidence and assurance use apply `A.10`, `B.3`, and relevant G patterns. |
| **Pattern-as-actor wording** | A pattern is presented as the actual actor writing, deciding, raising assurance, authorizing work, or creating project records. Use `F.19` to recover the capable participant and separate the claim-bearing text, project-side records, governing FPF pattern, and its application; retain ordinary metonymy when that participant and relation remain recoverable. |

### C.29:9 - Conformance Checklist

`C.29` checklist verifies the output-choice discipline without replacing the `Solution`. Candidate-lens guidance belongs in `C.29:4.4.3` or worked grounding, not in this checklist; the checklist verifies only that the cheapest honest output and next lens-use action remain visible.

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CC-C29-0 Use condition` | Use C.29 only when a mathematical object, formalism, family, learned representation, or simulation object is used for explanation, decision, prediction, publication, comparison, assurance input, bridge, or reusable transfer, or when a stable problem needs a first candidate lens that could change the next lens-use action. | Keeps local analogies lightweight. |
| `CC-C29-1 Output class selected before full card` | Select no-C.29-output-needed, `LensCandidateNote`, one-line, mini-card, full-card, or `NeighborGoverningPatternNote` output before presenting full-card fields. | Prevents card-before-problem bureaucracy. |
| `CC-C29-2 Named mathematical object` | A mathematical phrase affecting explanation, decision, prediction, publication, comparison, assurance input, bridge, or reusable transfer names a concrete `CandidateMathObject`, not a prestige family label. | Blocks prestige vocabulary. |
| `CC-C29-2a Intervention preservation` | If `LensMappingMode` is abstraction, quotient, coarse-graining, macro-model, or simulation and causal use is being claimed, state whether intervention and counterfactual structure is preserved, approximated, or not claimed, then apply `C.28` for causal-use question and verdict. | Prevents causal abstraction laundering. |
| `CC-C29-3 Lens mapping mode` | State the `C.29`-local lens mapping mode and do not use it as `F.9` BridgeKind, `A.6.P` relation kind, or `A.6.RCD` derivation/admission result. Formula, query, path, graph, diagram, assertion, and definition remain representation or claim-side objects; if bridge semantics are claimed, apply `F.9`. | Prevents hidden bridge, relation-kind, occurrence-identity, or ontology conversions. |
| `CC-C29-4 Preserved structure` | State what structure the lens preserves. | Makes transfer testable. |
| `CC-C29-5 Lost structure` | State what does not transfer; if nothing is lost, justify an equivalence or isomorphism claim through the subject pattern. | Prevents map-territory collapse. |
| `CC-C29-6 Invariants exposed` | Name invariants, obstructions, fixed points, symmetries, conservation laws, dualities, distinctions, or diagnostic boundaries. | Makes the lens usefulness visible. |
| `CC-C29-6a First-principles family recovery` | When a first-principles lens-family row from `C.29:4.2b` is used for claim-bearing lens use, recover the concrete `CandidateMathObject` for the candidate family, preserved structure, lost structure, visible payoff, lens-use boundary value, and stop condition or neighboring-pattern application for that family. | Prevents family names such as boundary, cohomology, symmetry, variational, RG, diagonal, composition, probability, information, or structural-information compression from replacing actual MathLensUse recovery. |
| `CC-C29-6b Bounded-observer structural-information lens` | When MDL, epiplexity, compression, graph information, or description-recoverability changes the next lens-use action, recover `TargetPhenomenon`, source episteme or trace, bounded observer, candidate measure or code, mapping mode, preserved and lost selected structure, visible payoff, observation or postulate boundary, source-return condition, lens-use boundary value, and stop condition. | Prevents C.29 from turning recoverable-structure estimates into architecture ontology, quality, selector, evidence, assurance, OOD, or causal claims. |
| `CC-C29-6c Architecture-local lens descriptions` | When `MLU.Description@RGArchitecture`, `MLU.Description@MultilevelLearningFrustration`, or another architecture-local lens description is used for claim-bearing lens use, recover declared scope or scale window, candidate mathematical object, mapping mode, preserved structure, lost structure, source-return condition, next lens-use action, and stop condition; apply the neighboring patterns that define or constrain architecture, scale-preference, measurement, evidence, assurance, selected-set, and decision claims. | Prevents architecture lens descriptions from becoming architecture ontology, RG proof, global-optimizer proof, scale preference, evidence, assurance, selector, or decision authority. |
| `CC-C29-7 Lens-bounded prediction or distinction` | When decision, prediction, model selection, or publication-as-model is being claimed, state at least one lens-bounded prediction, distinction, obstruction, or diagnostic boundary, or downgrade to analogy-only prompt. | Prevents decorative formalism. |
| `CC-C29-8 State, observation, and evidence separation` | If state, observation, probe, readout, or evidence is being claimed, apply `A.3.3`, `A.19`, `C.16`, or `A.10` as needed. | Prevents passive-read and dashboard mistakes. |
| `CC-C29-8a Neighboring claim distribution` | If the output being made is a choice result, method or work record, evidence relation, assurance claim, explanation rendering, comparative review unit, representation shift, coarsened rendering, temporal claim, selector, benchmark, or publication-facing use, name the governing FPF pattern and project-side record. | Prevents C.29 from absorbing neighboring claims. |
| `CC-C29-9 Scale window` | If scale, universality, knees, exponents, or coarse-graining are being claimed, declare the scale range and use `C.18.1` for scale-law adequacy, `C.19.1` for general method scale preference, and `C.31.ASAP` for architecture scale preference when the respective claim is made. | Prevents universalization. |
| `CC-C29-9a Temporal use boundary` | If the claim being made is about forecast, rate, trajectory, rhythm, recovery, convergence, stabilization, speed, temporal window, or rate-change as sufficient for a use, cite `C.27` or state that temporal adequacy is not being claimed. | Prevents mathematical prediction cues from replacing temporal-claim adequacy. |
| `CC-C29-10 Rival lens discipline` | Use a principal rival or default ordinary lens by default; require a broader rival set only for selection, publication, or claim-bearing comparison. When a rival relation is being claimed, name the declared relation value and any evaluation criterion, cost, reader, scale window, or neighboring pattern that makes the comparison bounded for use. | Prevents unnecessary literature-review work and unnamed lens-superiority claims. |
| `CC-C29-10a Validation regime` | If the lens is used for prediction, publication, assurance input, benchmark, model selection, or scientific claim or model claim, add validation regime, evaluation slice, uncertainty or approximation note, failure case, domain of applicability, and output-change condition when needed. | Keeps prediction-bearing and model-bearing uses SoTA-aligned. |
| `CC-C29-10b Source-use relation` | If a source changes C.29 declared lens use, name its `SourceUseRelation` with source material reference, declared C.29 output or lens-use boundary, source-use disposition, source-currentness or supersession condition, and output-change condition. Include a blocked source-prestige overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. | Separates the source-use relation from source-use disposition and makes its governing slots recoverable. |
| `CC-C29-10c Source-currentness and return condition` | If source material, source-use family, source-use decision, or a neighboring subject pattern changes the declared lens-use boundary for this output, state `SourceReturnCondition?` or `OutputChangeCondition?` and narrow, demote, replace, retire, or block the claim-bearing use. | Keeps SoTA currentness and neighboring-pattern currentness tied to the declared C.29 output rather than to source prestige or process evidence. |
| `CC-C29-11 LensUseBoundaryValue` | Label `LensUseBoundaryValue` as analogy-only prompt, diagnosticOnly, formal derivation, simulation, empirical fit, accepted domain theory, SoTA-echo candidate, or mechanized proof, with a matching declared-use boundary. | Prevents evidence laundering. |
| `CC-C29-12 No ontology smuggling` | Do not import source-domain ontology without separate proof or evidence and subject pattern. | Protects FPF from metaphysical collapse. |
| `CC-C29-13 Stop condition` | State the condition for narrowing, stopping, returning to source material, or applying a neighboring pattern. | Makes closure locally visible. |
| `CC-C29-14 Bridge discipline` | Cross-context mathematical transfer cites `F.9` when semantic correspondence between local senses is needed; Bridge and C.29 fields agree without duplicate writing. | Keeps semantics bounded. |
| `CC-C29-15 Causal-use discipline` | Causal-use claims apply `C.28`; C.29 cannot carry a causal-use verdict by itself. | Blocks causal laundering. |
| `CC-C29-16 Assurance discipline` | Assurance, release, reliability, and engineering-justification claims apply their direct subject patterns: `A.10` for evidence reliance, `B.3` only for an actual named assurance claim, the direct domain pattern for the release, reliability, or engineering-justification result, and relevant G patterns for their claims. | Prevents elegance from raising assurance directly. |
| `CC-C29-17 C.2.P recovery` | Broad heads, source wording or target wording, mapping wording, pattern-application wording, and Plain metaphors are recovered to FPF kinds named by value, fields, neighboring patterns, or explicit non-transfer dispositions. | Keeps the pattern from minting parallel ontology. |
| `CC-C29-18 Plain and Tech balance` | A Plain sentence can remain when it aids recognition; if it makes ontology, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or use-boundary commitment, that commitment is recovered through the Tech fields or neighboring pattern. | Preserves didactic usefulness without shadow semantics. |
| `CC-C29-19 Non-use and false-positive bank` | The pattern includes non-use examples for ordinary local domain equations, local graph data structures, A.19 overlays, local category proofs, and one-off metaphors. | Prevents C.29-everywhere. |
| `CC-C29-20 Repair matrix` | Failed checks map to repair outputs: downgrade, narrow, add loss, add evidence or validation, choose a rival lens, apply a neighbor, block an unsupported use, or stop and return. | Keeps C.29 as a repair pattern. |
| `CC-C29-21 Validation harness` | Stable-pattern review requires the small harness cases in §11a or an accepted equivalent validation record. | Makes repeated validation visible without turning the harness into a benchmark mandate. |

### C.29:10 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What it looks like | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| **Map-territory collapse** | “The organization is a quantum system.” | “A quantum-like lens models order, probe, or contextual-probability effects; no physical quantum ontology is licensed.” |
| **Prestige substitution** | “Use category theory” without naming objects, morphisms, functors, preservation, or loss. | Name the categorical structure, preserved composition or interface, and failed transfer. |
| **Family-name as object** | `field`, `graph`, `category`, `RG`, or `quantum` appears as if the family name were enough. | Name the concrete object, structure, formal position, or downgrade to Plain recognition. |
| **C.29-everywhere** | Every measurement template, score, graph, kernel, ODE, equation, or local formal object is treated as requiring `C.29`. | Require lens-transfer, publication, assurance, bridge, comparison, or reusable-explanation use. |
| **Card-before-problem** | The author fills fields before stating the working phrase and first repair. | Begin with the phrase, stated use, output class, and first repair output. |
| **Local-theory over-escalation** | Accepted local dynamics or domain equations are treated as needing C.29 by default. | Keep them under the local domain pattern or `A.3.3` unless a separate lens-transfer claim, publication use, assurance input, bridge, comparison, or reusable-explanation use is being made. |
| **False exactness** | Equivalence, isomorphism, or representation is declared by value when only analogy, fit, or simulation exists. | Downgrade `LensMappingMode` or justify the declared relation named by value through the subject pattern. |
| **RG-as-vibe** | “Everything is coarse-graining” with no scale window, coarse-graining rule, or fixed point. | Declare scale variable, coarse-graining rule, invariants, and rival micro-models. |
| **Elegant-math override** | A specialized or elegant mathematical lens is selected over a more general or scale-amenable alternative because of elegance or prestige while a general method scale-preference claim or architecture scale-preference claim is being made. | Use BLP scale-audit when a general method scale-preference claim is being made; use C.31.ASAP when an architecture scale-preference claim is being made; otherwise mark the lens as local and bounded by `C.29` stop condition. |
| **Familiar math misses needed structure** | A graph, linear trend, average, two-characteristic chart, or score is used because it is familiar while the working problem needs uncertainty, topology, dynamics, causal structure, scale law, distribution geometry, or operator view. | Name the working problem cue; choose a lens family that exposes the missing structure, or keep the simple math as local orientation only and block transfer, decision, evidence, assurance, publication, bridge, comparison, or reusable-explanation use. |
| **Vanchurin over-adoption** | “FPF now says physics is learning.” | Mark as candidate lens; retain open questions and evidence limits. |
| **Invariant-free metaphor** | “Market is a field” with no invariant, transition law, observation map, or `LensUseBoundaryValue`. | Downgrade to local metaphor or build a `MathLensUse.OneLine` or mini-card. |
| **Loss-free bridge** | Mathematical structure is exported across semantic contexts as a Bridge without `F.9`, loss notes, counter-example, or declared lens use. | Use `F.9` Bridge plus MathLensUse `LostStructure` and `StopCondition`. |
| **Duplicate bridge writing** | C.29 repeats sense cells, CL, substitution scope, and Bridge-declared lens use. | Use `F.9` to establish Bridge semantics; cite Bridge from the C.29 output. |
| **LensMappingMode as BridgeKind** | A local `LensMappingMode` value is used to skip `F.9`. | Do not define a bridge-valued `LensMappingMode`; use a local transfer class only for declared lens use and apply `F.9` to cross-context meaning, Bridge-dependent substitution, CL, sense cells, or Bridge-declared lens use. |
| **Causal laundering** | Lens fit is treated as proof of intervention effect. | Apply `C.28` and evidence design, or block causal use. |
| **Assurance laundering** | Elegant formalism is treated as release confidence. | Use the direct release pattern, `A.10` for evidence reliance, and `B.3` only for an actual named assurance claim; C.29 can be evidence input only when `LensUseBoundaryValue` and validation regime are declared. |
| **LensUseBoundaryValue laundering** | `SoTA-echo candidate` sounds like authority. | Restrict to exploration or lens-use tests unless validation and neighboring evidence patterns define or constrain prediction, decision, causal use, bridge substitution, assurance, or ontology. |
| **RivalLensSet as literature review** | The C.29 application produces a survey instead of naming the rival lens being compared. | Use `PrincipalRivalLens?` by default; add `RivalLensRelation?` when disagreement changes the next lens-use action; broaden to `RivalLensSet?` only when publication, selection, or claim-bearing comparison is being made. |
| **StopCondition boilerplate** | The card says only “does not prove everything.” | State the concrete stop, no-lens exit, or source-return condition; include a blocked overread only when it passes F.19's plausible-reader test. |
| **Neighbor absorption** | C.29 repeats `F.9`, `C.28`, `A.3.3`, `A.19`, `C.11`, `A.15`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `C.16`, `C.27`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.3.CSC`, or assurance semantics. | Apply the subject-pattern table and cite the neighboring pattern. |
| **Plain metaphor carrying law** | “What survives transfer” becomes an unstated Tech claim. | Recover the commitment through `C.2.P` fields or keep it as ordinary Plain recognition only. |
| **C.29 local-kind inflation** | `MathLensUse.Card` is treated as a universal `U.*` object or durable FPF record. | Keep it pattern-local; durable cross-pattern records require explicit minting or reuse, naming, kind, and design-rationale decision through `F.8`, `F.18`, `C.3`, and `E.9`. |

### C.29:11 - Consequences

| Benefit | Cost or handling |
|---|---|
| FPF gains a general discipline for mathematical lens use while mathematical lenses stay tied to declared structure, declared loss, and declared lens use. | Adds one new pattern; neighboring-pattern applications govern evidence, causal, bridge, assurance, work, decision, publication, and FPF-kind-governance uses. |
| Existing specialized lenses such as `C.26` become easier to explain as special cases. | `C.26` needs only relation wording, not a rewrite of its core. |
| Authors get a small checklist before using terms such as field, quantum, category, RG, manifold, graph, or information geometry. | Some quick analogies will be downgraded to local prose; this is intended. |
| Vanchurin-like speculative work can enter as candidate-lens stress tests. | Requires strict Adapt-not-Adopt marking. |
| Cross-domain transfer becomes auditable through preserved structure and lost structure and stop conditions. | More upfront statement effort; reduces downstream epistemic precision repair. |
| `C.29` can stay readable rather than becoming a dry ontology form. | Requires a Plain and Tech discipline: Plain metaphors can guide recognition, but Tech fields govern claim-bearing uses. |

### C.29:11a - Validation harness for stable-pattern review and material refresh

For stable-pattern review or material refresh of `C.29`, run a small C.29 validation harness. The harness is not a benchmark mandate and not a tool requirement. It is a repeatable validation check that the pattern yields correct first outputs, avoids false positives, preserves neighboring-pattern writing boundaries, and keeps the first useful lens-use action visible.

This subsection governs steward-side validation, not the ordinary C.29 user application. A working user applies the output-choice discipline and chooses the cheapest honest output; they do not run the harness merely to decide between ordinary prose, `MathLensUse.OneLine`, `MathLensUse.MiniCard`, or `NeighborGoverningPatternNote`.

C.29 output-change conditions:

| New condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| validation slice fails, degrades, or no longer matches the stated regime | Change `LensUseBoundaryValue` to the updated boundary value, update the failure case, narrow the declared lens use, or block prediction-facing use. |
| a principal rival lens changes the next lens-use action | Add `PrincipalRivalLens?` and `RivalLensRelation?`, or replace the lens for that use. |
| the lens becomes decision-facing, publication-facing, assurance-input, benchmark, model-selection, prediction, or repeated cross-case claim input | Use `MathLensUse.FullCard` and the applicable overlay or governing FPF pattern. |
| source-use relation becomes outdated, contradicted, or demoted to background only | Change the `SourceUseRelation`, update the lens-use boundary value, or retire the lens from claim-bearing use. |
| bridge, causal, measurement, scale, temporal, evidence, assurance, selector, or benchmark claim is being made | Name the governing neighboring pattern and keep C.29 to the declared lens-use part. |
| abstraction, compression, coarse-graining, or latent representation drops a distinction now needed for the declared use | Add `SourceReturnCondition?`, narrow the use, or block the compressed-lens claim. |

Smallest source-return and output-change conditions:

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| source material or a source family changes the lens family, validation boundary, limitation, or stated use used by this C.29 output | Update `SourceUseRelation`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, and `OutputChangeCondition?`; narrow, replace, or retire claim-bearing use when the new source-use row no longer fits the declared use. |
| a later source supersedes or contradicts the source-use decision that bounded the lens use | Mark the source-use decision as superseded or contradicted for that use, then select a new source-use relation, lower the output class, or block claim-bearing use. |
| a neighboring subject pattern changes the declared lens-use boundary for measurement, evidence, causal use, assurance, Bridge semantics, scale law, selector, benchmark, decision, or work | Keep C.29 only for the declared lens-use part and apply the changed subject pattern to the neighboring claim before the C.29 output is reused. |
| the same lens family starts carrying validation, causal-use, evidence, assurance, selector, benchmark, release, or work claim | Add the subject-pattern application, or narrow the C.29 result to lens-bounded prediction, distinction, obstruction, diagnostic boundary, or stop condition only. |
| preserved structure or lost structure can no longer be replayed from the source-domain variables, observations, cases, mechanism, or episteme | Add `SourceReturnCondition?`, restate `PreservedStructure` and `LostStructure`, lower the output class, or block the compressed-lens claim. |

AI-assisted thin-echo result rule:

| Thin echo or query shape | Required result |
|---|---|
| `field-like`, `quantum-like`, `category-like`, `manifold`, `entropy`, `RG`, `graph`, `embedding`, or another mathematical prestige head appears alone | Do not answer from the family label. First name the use under repair or state that no C.29 use is being made. |
| claim being made is causal, measurement, bridge, evidence, temporal, work, assurance, selector, or benchmark-facing | Name the governing FPF pattern before any C.29 output. |
| C.29 still applies after the subject-pattern check | Return at least `CandidateMathObject`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `NextLensUseAction`, and `StopCondition`, or downgrade to `LensCandidateNote` or `NoMathLensUseNeededNote`. |

C.29 edge-case boundary results:

| Edge case | Required result |
|---|---|
| mechanized proof of a model property | State assumptions and proven property; empirical evidence or assurance use stays with `A.10`, `B.3`, or relevant G patterns. |
| simulation-calibrated lens | Scenario exploration is allowed; prediction, decision, or counterfactual reliance needs validation and the neighboring-pattern result named by value. |
| latent-space visualization | Use learned-lens overlay and stop latent ontology, causal mechanism, or unobserved-variable recovery unless separately governed by the neighboring pattern governing that claim. |
| isomorphism or equivalence claim named by value | Justify the relation named by value or downgrade `LensMappingMode`. |
| multi-lens composition | Name the principal lens and neighboring notes; avoid one giant full card that mixes queue, graph, causal, temporal, and assurance authority. |
| lens becomes accepted domain theory | Keep local domain theory with the domain pattern; durable FPF naming or kind change needs `F.18`, `C.3`, `F.8`, and `E.9`. |
| mathematical notation shift only | Use `A.6.3.RT` unless mathematical-lens use changes the declared use. |
| coarsened explanation | Use `A.6.3.CSC` for source-bearing return, narrowed use, and coarsened rendering; cite C.29 only for abstraction adequacy. |

Harness shape:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CaseId` | Stable case id. |
| `InputPhrase` | The phrase or claim a cold user might write. |
| `ExpectedFirstPattern` | `C.29`, a neighboring pattern, or no C.29 output needed. |
| `ExpectedMathLensUseOutputClass` | `NoMathLensUseNeeded`, `LensCandidateNote`, `OneLine`, `MiniCard`, `FullCard`, or `NeighborGoverningPatternNote`. |
| `RequiredFields` | Minimal fields or overlays required. |
| `NeighborPatternRefs` | Neighboring subject patterns named by value when their claims are being made. |
| `ExpectedRepair` | Downgrade, narrow, add loss, add evidence or validation, choose a rival lens, apply a neighbor, or block an unsupported use. |
| `ExpectedStopCondition` | Concrete narrowing, stop, source-return, or neighboring-pattern condition. |
| `ExpectedNonUseDecision` | Present only for false-positive cases. |

Minimum harness cases:

| Case | Expected result |
|---|---|
| “organization is quantum” | `C.26` plus `C.29` compatibility only if order or probe effects are being claimed; otherwise downgrade to metaphor; physical quantum ontology blocked. |
| Markov kernel in accepted local reliability model | `A.3.3`; no full `MathLensUse.FullCard` unless lens-transfer, publication, assurance, bridge, or reusable explanation is being claimed. |
| category-like research field | `C.29` mini-card and possibly `F.9`; semantic truth and evidence relation explicitly lost. |
| RG-like scale law | `C.29` plus `C.18.1`; scale window and coarse-graining rule required. |
| Vanchurin-style universe-as-learning | candidate lens only; not accepted physics; stop condition blocks ontology. |
| queueing production line | positive mini-card; throughput and latency reasoning admitted; human meaning, contractual obligations, and unmodeled rare events remain explicit losses; stop or narrow when assumptions fail or those losses affect the use. |
| team backlog behaves like a queue | mini-card admits waiting and bottleneck reasoning; motivation and duty remain explicit losses; return or change lens when those losses prevent the next action. |
| same graph formalism in two contexts | `F.9` governs any needed semantic correspondence between local senses; `C.29` governs declared lens use. |
| latent manifold or neural operator as scientific model | learned-lens overlay requires observation map, data or training regime, validation regime, generalization claim, uncertainty note, and stop condition. |

Reader-fit checks for stable-pattern review or material refresh:

| Reader | Required result |
|---|---|
| engineer-manager | Can decide local metaphor, one-line, or mini-card without using the full card by default. |
| researcher | Can state preserved structure, lost structure, and stop condition without turning the pattern into a philosophy-of-mathematics essay. |
| FPF steward | Can identify the subject pattern for causal, evidence, bridge, scale, measurement, dynamics, temporal, decision, work, explanation, comparison, representation, or assurance claim before accepting a C.29 claim. |
| SoTA author | Can mark a source as adopt, adapt, reject, or candidate stress test without laundering speculative work into accepted FPF law. |
| AI-assisted reader | Recovers `C.29` or the neighboring subject pattern from the query, and does not answer from a thin echo such as `field-like`, `quantum-like`, or `category-like` alone. |

### C.29:12 - Rationale

#### C.29:12.1 - Why this improves FPF

The selected first-principles position in `C.29` is operational, not metaphysical. It treats first-principles mathematical thinking as local construction discipline: declare the smallest structure, rule, invariant, resource condition, observation, or consistency boundary from which the next lens-use action follows or is blocked. In that sense, a `C.29` application puts mathematical construction before adequacy control: the reader can introduce a queue, graph, state space, measure, topology, algebraic structure, variational quantity, simulation object, or learned representation when that structure improves the work, and then record the mapping, preserved structure, lost structure, lens-use boundary value, and stop condition.

First-principles mathematical structures can come from several families without turning any one family into an FPF-wide foundation: signatures, logics, axioms, type or abstraction distinctions, symmetries, invariants, compositional structure, local-global relations, scale relations, boundary conditions, variational principles, action, energy, free-energy, loss, or value functionals, constrained optimization structure, probability, information, typicality, algorithmic construction, resource bounds, implementation constraints, consistency boundaries, causal or intervention-preservation questions, operator or function-space mappings, and declared observation maps. Each use still needs declared mapping, preserved structure, lost structure, validation regime or lens-use boundary value, and stop condition.

This fits FPF because FPF already commits to state explicitness, bounded contexts, evidence and assurance, cross-context bridges, open-ended evolution, SoTA alignment, notational independence, and avoidance of ornamental formalism.

`C.29` makes an existing discipline explicit: when FPF uses a `CandidateMathObject`, local formalism, learned representation, simulation object, or mathematical family as a mathematical lens for a stated use, the `C.29` application declares what that use preserves, what it loses, what it makes visible, which rival lenses still change the next lens-use action, and where its declared lens use stops.

The compact Plain line remains useful because it points to a real heuristic: good mathematical lenses are not decoration; they are compact ways of seeing structures that survive transfer. The Plain line stays readable, while the card and checklist record the FPF commitments named by value.

#### C.29:12.2 - Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Keep only local math-lens hooks | Leaves no general conformance pattern; `C.26`-style guardrails do not transfer to non-QL lenses. |
| Add only a paragraph to `A.6.P` | Overloads relational precision restoration with general modeling adequacy. |
| Add only a paragraph to `F.9` | Bridge discipline is about cross-context semantics; C.29 also governs within-context mathematical representation. |
| Treat Vanchurin as a new FPF foundation | Too speculative and ontology-bearing; selected source-use disposition is candidate-lens stress test only. |
| Treat Sandberg thread as a foundations list | Useful recognition cue, but not a proof source, closed taxonomy, or FPF law. |
| Require a fixed list of permitted lens families | Would make first repair depend on list membership instead of declared structure, loss, and declared lens use. |
| Make mechanized proof mandatory for every C.29 output | Too narrow. Mechanized proof can be one `LensUseBoundaryValue` value, but adequacy can also rest on accepted domain theory, formal derivation, simulation, or empirical fit. |

#### C.29:12.3 - Pillar impact analysis

| Pillar | Impact |
|---|---|
| `P‑1 Cognitive Elegance` | Positive: first-principles structure becomes visible without ornamental formalism; one lens-use card replaces many prestige metaphors while example rows stay subordinate to declared fields and declared lens use. |
| `P‑2 Didactic Primacy` | Positive: first-minute use starts with the useful question "what structure changes the next lens-use action?", then Plain wording remains backed by recoverable Tech fields. |
| `P-3 Scalable Formality` | Positive: admits maturation from ordinary cue to candidate lens, one-line repair, formal derivation, validation regime, or evidence-backed domain theory. |
| `P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel` | Positive if placed in Part C, not Kernel; avoids making any mathematical family or foundation a kernel axiom. |
| `P‑5 FPF Layering` | Positive: `C.29` becomes a modular parent pattern or coordinator for specific mathematical lenses while neighboring patterns keep their own authority. |
| `P‑6 Lexical Stratification` | Positive: separates Plain "lens" from technical `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `StopCondition`, and evidence fields. |
| `P‑7 Pragmatic Utility` | Positive if every mathematical-lens use result changes a lens-bounded prediction, distinction, obstruction, model choice, diagnostic boundary, or stop condition. |
| `P‑8 Cross‑Scale Consistency` | Positive: scale windows, coarse-graining, local-global relations, composition, dynamics, symmetry, and boundary conditions become declared rather than assumed. |
| `P-9 State Explicitness` | Positive: state, observation, dynamics, measurement, lens-use boundary value, and stop-condition fields cite `A.3.3`, `A.19`, `C.16`, and `A.10` when those claims are being made. |
| `P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution` | Positive: new lens families and first-principles modeling structures can be added without destabilizing Core. |
| `P‑11 SoTA Alignment` | Positive: admits current mathematical modeling, applied category theory, scientific machine learning, causal abstraction, learning-dynamics research, and plural foundations without over-adopting them. |

#### C.29:12.4 - Principle-taxonomy balance

| Pillar | C.29 effect |
|---|---|
| `Gov` | New mathematical-lens use norms require `E.9` design-rationale discipline and SoTA discipline when they alter FPF norms. |
| `Arch` | Wrong subject-pattern assignment is blocked; `C.29` coordinates but does not replace neighboring patterns. |
| ontology and episteme distinction | Representation, mapping, preservation, loss, and `LensUseBoundaryValue` are explicit. |
| `Prag` | A useful lens produces a useful prediction, distinction, obstruction, or stop condition; otherwise it remains didactic prose. |
| `Did` | The card gives a small first-use check while experts can inspect field meanings named by value. |

### C.29:13 - SoTA-Echoing

SoTA source use for `C.29` is accepted only when it changes action guidance. A citation that only decorates the file does not establish `C.29` use.

`C.29` separates source-use relations from source-use disposition. `Adopt`, `Adapt`, `Reject`, and candidate-stress-test disposition say what FPF does with the source; `SourceUseRelation` says what work the source may perform inside a C.29 application.

Local `SourceUseRelation` slot discipline:

- source material reference or locator;
- declared C.29 output, lens-use boundary, or `LensUseBoundaryValue` affected by that source;
- source-use disposition: adopt, adapt, reject, candidate stress test, recognition cue, source identity locator, checked source-text carrier, or historical background only;
- currentness, supersession, contradiction, narrowing, or demotion condition;
- output-change condition for the C.29 result;
- stop or return condition, and any blocked overread that passes F.19's plausible-reader test.

| `SourceUseRelation` | Declared `C.29` use | Use boundary or return |
|---|---|---|
| `recognitionCue` | Help the reader notice an invariant, obstruction, symmetry, duality, state variable, scale cue, or comparison cue. | For evidence, truth, ontology, a causal-use verdict, assurance, or release confidence, establish that separate claim and its basis through its subject pattern. |
| `candidateLensPrompt` | Suggest a first candidate lens family or mathematical object to test against the problem cue being repaired. | Test a candidate cheaply when it could change the next lens-use action; require use of that lens only after its contribution is established. |
| `adequacyControlSource` | Discipline preserved structure, lost structure, stop condition, validation regime, or neighboring-pattern application. | Satisfy C.29's field requirements and the applicable subject pattern for the resulting claim. |
| `validationBoundarySource` | Constrain the declared validation regime, evaluation slice, uncertainty, failure case, or domain of applicability. | An evidence relation, assurance claim, benchmark result, or release confidence requires its own basis and subject-pattern result. |
| `acceptedDomainTheory` | Permit local use inside a domain where the theory is already the governing local formalism. | For cross-context ontology import or broader transfer, establish the needed evidence relation and a stop condition; apply `F.9` when semantic correspondence between local senses is needed. |
| `proofUnderAssumptions` | Justify a formal property under stated assumptions. | A formal proof can support a real-world-adequacy claim only when its assumptions, observations, and evidence relation are also established, together with any needed semantic Bridge. |
| `negativeExample` | Expose failure, obstruction, non-transfer, counterexample, or stop condition. | Scope the result to the demonstrated failure and its return condition. |
| `rivalLensSource` | Name a principal rival lens or relation that changes the bounded lens-use action being made. | Keep the principal-rival choice bounded to the current lens-use action. Undertake a literature review, or establish a selector or benchmark result, only for that separately current question. |
| `sourceIdentityLocator` | Preserve source identity by value when a source is being cited or traced. | Use a separate source-use relation and adequacy basis when the claim needs substantive support. |
| `historicalBackgroundOnly` | Explain lineage or terminology. | For present-day prediction, decision, Bridge, causal, assurance, or FPF-kind-governance use, establish a current source-use relation and apply its subject pattern. |

The selected SoTA lines contribute the following guidance:

| SoTA line | Selected action-guidance effect | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Applied category theory and compositionality | Use category-theoretic material for composition, interfaces, views, transformations, and transport discipline. Require named structure, preserved composition or interface, lost structure, and failed transfer. | **Adapt.** Useful for composition and interface questions when those structures matter to the stated use. |
| Obstructions to compositionality | Treat failures and obstructions as first-class `LostStructure` and `StopCondition` material. | **Adapt.** A lens can be useful because it names where transfer fails. |
| Plural foundations of mathematics | Allow multiple structural families with local adequacy, declared mapping, and declared loss. | **Adopt.** Source-use relation: plural-foundations source-use decision. |
| Geometric deep learning, invariance, and equivariance | Use symmetry, group action, invariance, and equivariant representation as lens-discovery cues when generic feature lists hide the relevant sameness under transformations. Ask which transformations are declared as preserved or invariant, which distinctions are preserved, and which coordinate details can be lost. | **Adapt as lens-discovery source.** Not evidence for domain law, causal mechanism, or coordinate-free truth. |
| Optimal transport and distribution geometry | Use transport plans, couplings, Wasserstein-like geometry, and declared movement cost as lens-discovery cues for population, distribution, shape, shift, or allocation questions. Ask what is transported, under which cost, and what structure or mass is lost. | **Adapt as lens-discovery source.** Not evidence for causality, fairness, mechanism, or policy effect. |
| Model reporting and responsible modeling practice | Intended use, evaluation conditions, limitations, validation regime, failure cases, uncertainty, and domain of applicability become C.29 validation fields for prediction, publication, assurance-input, benchmark, model-selection, and scientific or model uses. | **Adapt.** Turns reporting practice into fields and repair actions. |
| Causal and approximate causal abstraction | When abstraction, quotient, coarse-graining, simulation, or macro-modeling is being claimed, ask whether intervention and counterfactual structure is preserved, approximated, or not claimed; use `C.28` for causal-use question and verdict when causal use is being claimed. Approximate abstraction is a source-backed lens-use note, not a softened causal-use grant. | **Adapt.** No C.29 output is causal authority. |
| Causal representation learning | Use causal-representation work as a discovery guard for latent variables, learned factors, interventions, assignments, and invariance across environments. If a latent lens is being read causally, keep causal-use question and verdict with `C.28`. | **Adapt as lens-discovery source.** Blocks “latent means causal”; does not make representation learning a causal verdict. |
| Scientific machine learning as hybrid first-principles and data-driven modeling | Treat first-principles structures as plural and domain-bound: conservation laws, constitutive relations, boundary conditions, symmetries, known dynamics, numerical stability, uncertainty, and data-driven approximation can each discipline a lens. Require the C.29 user to name the concrete structure and validation boundary rather than saying "science says so." | **Adapt.** Reinforces the first-principles position without making any one SciML family the FPF foundation. |
| Variational principles and constrained extrema | Use action, energy, free-energy, loss, value, entropy, or resource functionals as first-principles lenses only when the constrained variation space, constraints, boundary conditions, stationarity or extremum condition, conserved or dual quantities, and neighboring dynamics applications and evidence applications are named. | **Adapt as first-principles lens-discovery source.** Does not imply the target literally optimizes the declared functional; dynamics, evidence, causal-use, and assurance claims are governed by neighboring patterns. |
| Physics-informed ML and learned scientific representations | Use physics-informed losses, governing equations, neural operators, surrogate solvers, and learned representations only with observation map, training or simulation regime, resolution or discretization policy, generalization claim, validation slice, uncertainty or approximation note, and stop condition. | **Adapt.** Contributes learned-lens overlay fields; does not license out-of-regime solver replacement, causal mechanism, or unobserved-state truth. |
| Scientific and physics foundation models | Treat foundation-model claims in scientific domains as learned-lens stress tests: broad pretraining, in-context dynamics inference, zero-shot or transfer claims, and cross-domain simulation all require declared training regime, task family, validation regime, uncertainty, failure cases, and output-change condition. | **Adapt as SoTA pressure.** A foundation-model result can suggest a candidate lens or benchmark question; it is not accepted FPF law and not a universal first-principles source. |
| Koopman, operator-theoretic dynamics, and system identification | Use observables, operator representations, dynamic-mode decomposition, and sparse identification as discovery cues for nonlinear dynamics. Name the state, observable or readout, forecast or control use being tested, and the governing dynamics or temporal-use pattern. | **Adapt as lens-discovery source.** Does not prove a real mechanism, dynamics semantics, evidence, or temporal-use adequacy. |
| Probabilistic programming, Bayesian workflow, and model criticism | Use priors, likelihood assumptions, posterior predictive checks, prior-data conflict, model mismatch, and uncertainty as lens-use cues. Ask what the probabilistic lens makes visible, what assumptions it imports, and where prediction or explanation stops. | **Adapt as lens-discovery and criticism source.** Not a truth verdict, evidence verdict, or assurance result by itself. |
| Modern Bayesian experimental design, OED, active sensing, and adaptive sampling | Use modern BED and OED, expected-information-gain estimation, acquisition-function, active-learning, Bayesian-optimization, and robustness results to ask which observation, probe, assignment, fidelity, or sample would change the lens's next lens-use action. Require declared utility, design variable, model assumptions, computational tractability, model-misspecification or robustness note, and validation boundary before using the result for prediction, decision, experiment planning, evidence, causal-use verdict, or assurance. | **Adapt as current lens-discovery source.** Not a measurement construction, evidence record, causal-use result, experiment plan, or assurance claim by itself. |
| Uncertainty, approximation, sensitivity, and robustness practice | Prediction or scientific or model use requires approximation or uncertainty note, known failure or counterexample, and domain of applicability. | **Adapt.** Prevents empirical-fit overread. |
| Vanchurin 2026 | Use as structure-dense candidate lens and overclaim stress-test: learning dynamics, coarse-graining, effective geometry, gauge, metric-tensor, or distance language, variational or thermodynamic optimality. | **Adapt, not adopt.** Not central SoTA authority and not accepted physics. |
| Sandberg structural-sameness examples | Use as recognition examples for invariants, obstructions, dualities, fixed points, symmetries, and conservation-like structures. | **Adopt as recognition cue and examples, not proof authority.** |

#### C.29:13.1 - Sandberg Thread and Structural Sameness Examples

Adopt the Sandberg thread as a recognition cue, with two distinct source-use functions retained: the original X post is the **source identity locator**, while the Axis of Ordinary `Math` section is the checked text carrier used here.

The source examples are not a proof source and not an exhaustive taxonomy. They are a checked example carrier for `InvariantsExposed`: generalized Stokes and boundary-exterior derivative duality; de Rham, cohomology, and topological obstruction; CLT as RG or fixed-point viewpoint; Lawvere-style diagonal family; Noether and symmetry-conservation; and Legendre, potential-duality, and tropical-limit family.

Plain register: the thread illustrates mathematical compression that makes hidden structure visible. Tech register: every FPF use still needs `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `LensUseBoundaryValue`, and `StopCondition`.

Do not adopt the thread as a proof source, peer-reviewed taxonomy, or authority for all mathematical details.

#### C.29:13.2 - Vanchurin 2026 as candidate lens

Adopt and adapt the following as a candidate lens family:

> **learning dynamics → coarse-graining → effective geometry → gauge fields, metric-tensor fields, or distance-like structure → variational or thermodynamic optimality**

Use this source as the case for why FPF needs a lens-use card: the source discusses many mathematical structures, but its claims are broad and speculative. The candidate-lens stress-test value comes through trainable variables, local update rules, Legendre transforms, thermodynamic potentials, gauge-field, metric-tensor-field, and distance-language claims, memory and processing trade-offs, and RG-like re-optimization of compressed representations.

The Plain lesson is “this is a useful candidate lens, not a new FPF cosmology.” Selected lens use:

**Adoption stance: Adapt, not Adopt.**

Adapt:

- learning dynamics as a general language of change,
- resource constraints as a possible source of effective laws,
- coarse-graining as a mechanism for simple macrodescriptions,
- thermodynamic or variational potentials as links between cost, memory, processing, and geometry,
- RG-like re-optimization as a scale-transition discipline.

Do not adopt as FPF norm:

- “the universe really is a neural network,”
- “physics has already been proven from learning,”
- “quantum, GR, or gauge theory reduce to a learning rule or learning dynamics” as established fact.

Known limitations from the checked source-use disposition remain material for mathematical-lens use: non-Abelian gauge fields are not treated as an established FPF result; thermodynamic RG flow is not treated as a quantitative FPF law; quantitative predictions require explicit learning-algorithm specification.

#### C.29:13.3 - Plural foundations source-use decision

Adopt the plural-foundations source-use decision: several structural families can be reusable across domains, and their adequacy depends on declared mapping, local use, mutual interpretability, and recoverable loss.

Source-use relation: Rodin supplies source material for the positive decision that several structurally useful families recur across domains. C.29 records this as local adequacy discipline: select the family that fits the declared use, state the mapping, and publish recoverable loss.

Rodin and P2W micro-slice — fill-in OneLine template. Before claim-bearing lens use, name the concrete `CandidateMathObject`, select the `LensMappingMode`, and state the use-specific `PreservedStructure` and `LostStructure`:

```text
MathLensUse.OneLine@RodinP2W:
  TargetPhenomenon: accepted problem-side distinction that may need later formal declaration
  CandidateMathObject: one selected formal structure or structural family
  LensMappingMode: exact formal equivalence, interpretation, homomorphism, or near-sameness candidate
  PreservedStructure: the invariant, composition law, obstruction, boundary relation, or formal relation that survives the lens use
  LostStructure: world-facing detail, measurement condition, causal condition, bridge loss, or implementation detail not preserved by the formal relation
  VisiblePayoff: the reader can decide whether a formal declaration is needed before mechanism, method, or work reasoning
  NextLensUseAction: apply `A.6.0` if a `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` declaration is needed; apply `E.18.1` if accepted problem-side material must be used through P2W in later FPF work
  StopCondition: return to the subject pattern when the needed claim concerns observation-bound world adequacy, causal use, an evidence relation, Bridge-declared lens use, or work-start conditions; use the formal result within its stated preservation and loss
```

Read the slice by the exact governed object and claim. `C.29` governs the `CandidateMathObject` designation, the selected mathematical representation and explicit correspondence, and the preserved and lost structure stated for that bounded mathematical-lens-use claim or note. It does not assert a world-side participation or direct use relation; such a relation requires a separate direct relation settlement with participant meanings, an obtaining predicate, applicability, and an identity rule. `A.6.0` governs the separate formal-declaration episteme when a `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` declaration of vocabulary, laws, imports, and applicability must be written. `E.18.1` governs P2W carry-through of the accepted problem-side distinction into the next declared FPF use. If the claim becomes measurement, evidence, causal use, Bridge semantics, mechanism realization, or work, apply `C.16`, `A.10`, `C.28`, `F.9`, `A.6.1`, or `A.15` to that claim being made. Use `A.15.5` when the needed result is work-entry readiness.

#### C.29:13.4 - Applied category theory

Adopt applied category theory as one major organizer for cross-domain transfer, especially composition, interfaces, views, transformations, and bridges. Retain the concrete source examples: databases, electric circuits, and dynamical systems as application families; adjoint functors, enriched categories, and toposes as categorical structures that organize transfer.

In `C.29`, category-theoretic material is used through the same local adequacy fields as any other lens: stated use, named structure, preserved composition or interface, lost structure, failed transfer, and neighboring-pattern applications. It is especially useful when composition, interfaces, views, transformations, or bridges matter to the bounded lens-use action.

#### C.29:13.5 - Obstructions to compositionality

Adapt the obstructions and failures-of-compositionality perspective into `LostStructure` and `StopCondition`: a lens can be useful precisely because it exposes where transfer fails, not only where it succeeds. In plain language, a good lens does not only say "this transfer holds"; it also names the boundary where transfer stops.

### C.29:13a - Source locators and source-use guard

Decision grounds and governing inheritance remain recoverable by value, and SoTA rows shape action guidance rather than decorate the file. The source locators and the source-use relation of each external source are retained here.

#### Source locators and governing-use rows

### C.29:13b - Source-use boundary notes

1. `VAN-GEOM-LEARNING-2025/2026` is a replayable candidate-lens source for geometric learning dynamics. Its useful FPF contribution is the metric-tensor, noise-covariance, and learning-dynamics lens family and the stress it puts on `CandidateMathObject`, `LensMappingMode`, preserved and lost structure, validation boundary, and stop condition.
2. Vanchurin-style physical or biological interpretations remain claims from the cited source unless a local C.29 output and neighboring evidence, causal-use, validation, or assurance pattern bound the use. C.29 does not promote those interpretations to FPF law.
3. `SAND-THREAD-MATH-LINKS-2026-05-12` is a recognition cue, not a mathematical proof source or FPF law.
4. CLT-as-RG or fixed-point wording is retained only as a structural modeling viewpoint. A safe formulation is: under the usual normalization, the Gaussian is an attractive fixed point for finite-variance distributions; other stable laws are other fixed points under suitable normalization.
5. The ontology guard is structure-preserving representation through an explicitly declared mapping.

### C.29:14 - Informative taxonomy seed

Use this recognition menu only to identify a possible lens family and likely neighboring-pattern applications. After selecting a row, state the local C.29 fields that make the lens adequate or stop the use.

| Lens family | What it catches | FPF use | Common stop condition | Likely neighboring patterns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Boundary, Stokes, and cohomology** | Boundary operators, exterior-derivative or divergence-like local-to-global relations, flows, closed/exact distinctions, and topological obstructions. | Use when local rules, interfaces, flows, or balances must be related to a global claim or blocked global extension. | Does not license all boundary phenomena as the same physical mechanism; evidence, measurement, and bridges remain neighboring work. | `F.9`, `A.19`, `C.16`, `A.10` |
| **Obstruction-first and failed-transfer lens** | Impossibility, incompatibility, failed composition, blocked transfer, missing invariant, or diagnostic boundary. | Use when the useful mathematical result marks where a transfer, comparison, model, or simplification stops. | Does not make the rival claim true or the failure cause known without the neighboring-pattern result named by value. | `F.9`, `A.6.P`, `A.10`, `E.19` |
| **Symmetry, invariance, equivariance, and Noether** | Group actions, invariants, equivariant representations, conservation-like constraints, and geometric-deep-learning regularities. | If the problem depends on sameness under transformations or a conservation-like claim, ask which transformations are declared as preserved or invariant, what remains invariant, and which distinctions are lost. | Does not transfer physical conservation law, causal mechanism, or coordinate-free truth without domain evidence. | `A.10`, `C.16`, `A.19`, domain pattern |
| **Variational, action, optimization, and Legendre** | Action, energy, free-energy, loss, value, entropy, or resource functionals; stationarity, extrema, dual variables, potentials, and Legendre or convex duality. | Use when the useful lens is an extremal condition, constrained variation space, boundary condition, dual view, or trade-off. | Does not imply the target literally optimizes unless dynamics and evidence-provenance claims are governed by their neighboring patterns. | `A.3.3`, `C.28`, `A.10`, `G.6` |
| **Diagonal, self-reference, and no-go** | Self-application, universal evaluators, closure limits, diagonal constructions, and impossibility boundaries. | Use when the payoff is to block a tempting universal claim or expose a closure boundary. | Does not prove every recursive-looking case is a diagonal or no-go case. | `B.3`, `E.19`, local domain pattern |
| **RG, coarse-graining, fixed point, and universality** | Why different micromodels yield one macropattern; fixed points, basins, scale windows, universality classes, or stable-law-like alternatives. | Use for scale transitions, abstraction, domain compression, and macropattern claims that require a declared scale variable and coarse-graining rule. | Does not assert micro-mechanism identity or universal applicability outside `ScaleWindow`. | `C.18.1`, `C.19.1`, `A.3.3` |
| **Category, compositionality, optics, and semiring-limit** | Composition, interfaces, views, transformations, algebraic laws, limit transforms, and cases where changing algebra changes what is preserved. | Multi-view architecture, bridges, system composition, and classical or tropical or Fourier-Laplace or Legendre-style transform cues. | Does not imply all target objects are categories or that every functor-like transfer preserves the needed structure. | `F.9`, `A.6.P`, `A.19` |
| **Information geometry and learning dynamics** | Update, curvature, optimization trajectory. | Adaptive systems, learning agents, epistemic dynamics. | Does not license “everything is learning” ontology. | `A.3.3`, `A.10`, `C.28` |
| **Optimal transport and distribution geometry** | Transport plans, Wasserstein-like geometry, couplings, costed movement between distributions, populations, shapes, or allocations. | Use when the question is how one distribution, population, shape, or allocation can move toward another under declared costs and losses. | Does not license causality, fairness, mechanism, or policy effect by itself. | `C.16`, `A.10`, `C.28`, `D.5` |
| **Operator learning, SciML, and latent representations** | Learned function-to-function operators, neural operators, surrogate solvers, embeddings, and world-model representations. | Use when the first useful lens is an operator over functions, states, or fields; name the observation map, training or simulation regime, validation slice, and generalization boundary. | Does not license out-of-domain solver replacement, causal mechanism, or unobserved state truth without validation and the neighboring-pattern result named by value. | `A.10`, `C.16`, `A.3.3`, `C.28` |
| **Koopman and operator-theoretic dynamics** | Observables or coordinates where nonlinear dynamics can be represented by an operator, often approximately linear. | Use when nonlinear dynamics need a tractable forecast, control, or diagnostic representation; name the observable or readout and the forecast or control use being tested. | Does not prove a real linear mechanism or temporal-use adequacy; dynamics semantics, evidence, and temporal claims stay with `A.3.3`, `A.10`, and `C.27`. | `A.3.3`, `A.10`, `C.27` |
| **Causal representation and causal abstraction** | Causal graphs, SCMs, causal representation learning, micro-to-macro mappings, quotient models, and intervention-preservation questions. | If the user asks what to change to get an effect, test causal graph, SCM, or causal abstraction as the candidate lens, not correlation graph or latent manifold by default. | `C.29` can state declared lens use only; causal-use question and verdict, intervention claims, and counterfactual reliance stay with `C.28`. | `C.28`, `A.10`, `A.3.3` |
| **Quantum-like and contextual probability** | Probe effects, incompatible frames, order effects. | Dashboards, workshops, surveys, measurement-as-intervention. | Quantum-like is not physical quantum unless separate physics evidence is supplied. | `C.26`, `C.16`, `F.9` |

### C.29:15 - Relations
- **Architecture lens boundary:** `C.32.P2S`, `C.32.PAD`, and `C.32.ADA` may cite C.29 lens outputs for preserved structure, lost structure, structural information, epiplexity, scale mapping, residual mapping, or source-return. C.29 does not decide the architecture and does not supply evidence, assurance, gate, or quality authority.
- **Structural-information adequacy boundary:** `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` may cite C.29 outputs when mathematical-lens results expose captured structure, preserved structure, lost structure, or discovery adequacy. The C.29 output stays local to lens use; it is not architecture adequacy, candidate admission, measurement, eval, evidence, assurance, or project decision authority.

- **Builds on:** `A.1.1`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.RCD`, `A.3.3`, `A.19`, `A.10`, `A.15`, `B.3`, `C.16.P`, `C.16`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `F.9`.

- **Design-rationale input:** `E.9` design-rationale discipline and the source-use rows in `C.29:13a`.
- **Contributes to:** `E.2` pillar-impact analysis when a pillar argument relies on mathematical first-principles structure; only declared mathematical-lens use is in scope, with no amendment to pillar content, priority, or constitutional authority.

- **Coordinates with:** `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.18.1`, `C.11`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.4`, `C.18.1`, `C.19.1`, `C.26`, `C.27.TA`, `C.27`, `C.28`, `C.31.ASAP`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.2`, `G.10`.
- **Specialization relation:** `C.26` is selected as a C.29-compatible specialization for quantum-like modeling, with affordability qualifications.
- **Neighboring claims stay with their subject patterns.** Use `F.9` for bridges; `C.28` for causal use; `A.3.3` for dynamics semantics; `A.19` and `C.16` for characteristic-space and measurement construction; `A.10` and `B.3` for evidence and assurance; `C.11` for decision records; `A.15` for method/Work alignment, `A.15.2` for plans, and `A.15.1` for performed Work; `A.15.4` for reliance on a misleading appearance; `E.17.*` for explanation and comparative-review publication use; `A.6.3.RT` and `A.6.3.CSC` for representation transition and coarsening; `C.27.TA`, `C.27`, `C.18.1`, `C.19.1`, and `C.31.ASAP` for temporal-aspect, temporal-claim adequacy, scale-law, method scale-preference, and architecture scale-preference claims; and Part G for selector and benchmark work. C.29 records only the declared mathematical-lens use and the subject-pattern boundary for the claim being made.
