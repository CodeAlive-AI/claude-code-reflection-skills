# Skills Manager

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List all | `python3 scripts/list_skills.py` |
| List by scope | `python3 scripts/list_skills.py -s user` or `-s project` |
| Show details | `python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name>` |
| Review skill | `python3 scripts/review_skill.py <name>` |
| Delete | `python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name>` |
| Move to user | `python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> user` |
| Move to project | `python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> project` |
| Create new | Use `/skill-creator` |

## Scopes

| Scope | Path | Visibility |
|-------|------|------------|
| User | `~/.claude/skills/` | All projects for this user |
| Project | `.claude/skills/` | This repository only |

User scope takes precedence over project scope for skills with the same name.

## Operations

### List Skills

```bash
python3 scripts/list_skills.py              # All skills
python3 scripts/list_skills.py -s user      # User scope only
python3 scripts/list_skills.py -f json      # JSON output
```

### Show Skill Details

```bash
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name>           # Basic info
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name> --files   # Include file listing
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name> -f json   # JSON output
```

### Review Skill

Audits a skill against best practices and suggests improvements:

```bash
python3 scripts/review_skill.py <name>         # Review with text output
python3 scripts/review_skill.py <name> -f json # JSON output for programmatic use
```

**Checks performed:**
- Name format (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars, gerund form)
- Description quality (triggers, third person, specificity)
- Body length (warns if >500 lines)
- Time-sensitive content
- Path format (no Windows backslashes)
- Reference depth (should be one level)
- Table of contents for long files

**After reviewing:** Read the skill's SKILL.md and apply the suggested fixes directly.

### Delete Skill

**CRITICAL**: Always use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before deleting: "Are you sure you want to delete the skill '[name]'? This cannot be undone."

```bash
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name>              # With script confirmation
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> --force      # Skip script prompt
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> -s project   # Target specific scope
```

### Move Skill

```bash
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> user      # Project → User (personal)
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> project   # User → Project (share with team)
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> user -f   # Overwrite if exists
```

### Modify Skill

1. Run `python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name>` to locate it
2. Edit SKILL.md directly at the returned path

### Create New Skill

Use the `/skill-creator` skill for guided creation with proper structure.

## Important Notes

- **Restart required**: After adding, removing, or moving skills, restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
- **Edits are immediate**: Changes to existing skill content work without restart
