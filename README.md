## Use Cases

### claude-mcp-manager

> Connect to databases, GitHub, APIs via MCP servers

**Connect to Your Database**
> *"Connect Claude to my PostgreSQL database"*

Installs the [database MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), configures your connection string. Now you can query your data conversationally.

**Install GitHub Integration**
> *"Connect Claude to GitHub so it can create PRs and manage issues"*

Installs the [official GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server). Claude can now create branches, PRs, and work with issues directly.

**Update API Keys**
> *"Update my CodeAlive API key in the MCP config"*

Edits your `~/.claude.json` or `.mcp.json` to update API keys. Perfect for rotating credentials without reinstalling.

**Bulk Update Server Config**
> *"Change the timeout for all my MCP servers to 120 seconds"*

Bulk updates MCP server configuration. Adjust timeouts, environment variables, or command args across all servers at once.

---

### claude-hooks-manager

> Auto-format, auto-test, log commands after edits

**Auto-Format Code**
> *"Run Prettier on TypeScript files after every edit"*

Adds a PostToolUse hook. Every file Claude touches gets formatted automatically — no more style inconsistencies.

**Auto-Run Tests**
> *"Run pytest whenever Claude edits Python files"*

Adds a PostToolUse hook for `*.py` files. Instant feedback on whether changes broke anything.

**Log All Commands**
> *"Log every command Claude runs to an audit file"*

Adds a PreToolUse hook that appends commands to `~/.claude/command-log.txt`. Full audit trail.

**Block Dangerous Commands**
> *"Add hook that blocks global rm -rf commands"*

Adds a PreToolUse hook that rejects destructive commands before they run. Protects against accidental data loss.

**Require Confirmation**
> *"Add hook that asks user permission for commands containing 'db reset'"*

Adds a PreToolUse hook that pauses and requests confirmation for database resets or other sensitive operations.

---

### claude-settings-manager

> Configure permissions, sandbox, model selection

**Enable Sandbox Mode**
> *"Turn on sandbox mode so Claude can work without asking permission for every command"*

Enables [native sandboxing](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing) — reduces permission prompts by 84% while keeping your system safe.

**Block Access to Secrets**
> *"Block Claude from reading .env files and anything in /secrets"*

Adds deny rules to permissions. Sensitive files stay protected even if Claude tries to access them.

**Switch Models**
> *"Use Opus model for this project"*

Updates settings to use `claude-opus-4-5` — better reasoning for complex architectural decisions.

**Share Team Configuration**
> *"Set up project settings so everyone gets the same Claude config"*

Creates `.claude/settings.json` in project scope. Commit once, entire team gets identical setup.

---

### claude-subagents-manager

> Create specialized agents for specific tasks

**Create a Code Reviewer**
> *"Create a reviewer subagent that can only read files, uses Opus for quality"*

Creates a [custom subagent](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) with `tools: Read, Grep, Glob` and `model: opus`. Thorough, insightful code reviews.

**Create a Test Runner**
> *"Create a subagent that runs tests and reports failures"*

Creates a specialized agent for running test suites with limited tool access for safety.

---

### claude-skills-manager

> Organize and share skills across projects

**List Available Skills**
> *"Show me all my installed skills"*

Lists skills from user and project scopes with their triggers and descriptions.

**Move Skills Between Scopes**
> *"Move this skill to my user scope so I can use it everywhere"*

Moves skills between project and user scopes for broader or narrower availability.

---

### claude-plugins-manager

> Package and publish your own plugins

**Create a Plugin**
> *"Create a new plugin with my custom skills"*

Scaffolds a new plugin structure with manifest, README, and skill directories.

**Publish to GitHub**
> *"Publish my plugin to GitHub"*

Packages your plugin and creates a GitHub release for others to install.

---

### claude-optimizer-skill

> Audit repos and optimize CLAUDE.md for agent work

**Audit Project Readiness**
> *"Check if this repo is set up well for Claude Code"*

Runs a comprehensive audit analyzing CLAUDE.md files, settings, MCP configs, and project structure. Returns prioritized recommendations (P0/P1/P2) with specific suggestions for improvement.

**Optimize CLAUDE.md**
> *"Review my CLAUDE.md and suggest improvements"*

Evaluates memory file quality: structure, conciseness, @import validation, essential sections (commands, architecture, conventions). Provides concrete edits to make your project more agent-friendly.
